<h2 class="no-break">PROLOGUE.</h2>


<p>The Comte de St. Germaine was a real historical
character. Of all the many adventurers
brilliant and volatile that flitted across the
polished surface of Parisian life during the
gay butterfly days of La Pompadour, none was
more interesting, none left a more fascinating
reflection, than he. No one knew who he was,
no one knew his antecedents, no one knew
whence he came, but there he suddenly appeared,
to shine transiently and somewhat luridly
for a year or two in a certain heaven of quasi
high life.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more sudden than
his advent. One day he was unheard of; the
next, all the world talked of him, gazed at him,
and wondered. Great people adopted him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>made much of him; courtiers and cabinet ministers
bowed to him; the king petted him, talked
with him in his privy closet by the hour, and
held long and intimate discourse with him. He
possessed the rare and distinguished privilege of
a free and familiar entrée to Madame de Pompadour's
dressing-room&mdash;a crowning honor, and
one only enjoyed by the greatest and most favored
courtiers.</p>

<p>And, indeed, the Parisian world had more
cause to wonder and to marvel at him than at
many another star that shone at different times
in that firmament. First it was a whisper that
got about that he was three, some said four, and
others five hundred years old. Then it was said
that there were those who had known him, gay,
handsome, brilliant, fifty years before&mdash;as gay,
as handsome, as brilliant. Then came a second
whispering rumor&mdash;that he was the richest man
in the world&mdash;a rumor also somewhat confirmed,
for there were those, whose word was indisputable,
who vouched to his having shown them incalculable
treasures of diamonds. He himself
never laid claim either to the extreme age or to
the incalculable treasure, but the world claimed
the one and talked of the other for him. And
all the talk and gossip seemed to be built upon
good foundation.</p>

<p>For example, said Madame de Pompadour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
him one day, "But you do not tell us your age,
and yet the Comtess de Gergy, who was ambassadress
at Vienna more than fifty years ago, says
that she saw you there then exactly the same as
you now appear."</p>

<p>"It is quite true, madame," replied St. Germaine,
quietly, "that I knew Madame de Gergy
many years ago."</p>

<p>"But, according to her account, you must be
more than a hundred years old?"</p>

<p>"That is not impossible," said he; and then
added, laughing, "but it is quite possible that
the countess is in her dotage."</p>

<p>As for his vast wealth, that also stood upon
substantial foundation. The Baron de Sleichen
says, in his Memoirs, that one day the count
showed him so many diamonds that he thought
he saw all the treasures of Aladdin's lamp spread
out before him. He showed Madame de Pompadour
a little box of precious stones worth
more than half a million livres. Says Madame
de Hausset: "The count came to see Madame
de Pompadour, who was very ill. He showed
her diamonds enough to furnish a king's treasury.
At still another time, when a number of
the principal courtiers were present, he visited
madame's apartments wearing magnificent diamond
knee and shoe buckles. At her request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
he went into an adjoining apartment and removed
them for closer inspection. They were
worth, M. de Gontat said, not less than twenty
thousand livres."</p>

<p>So it came about that the Comte de St. Germaine
shone, a brilliant star in his firmament,
for a while; then suddenly he vanished, and the
Parisian world saw him no more. For six days
that world wondered and speculated concerning
his disappearance; then, on the seventh day, it
forgot him.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">ACT I.</h2>




<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene First.</span>&mdash;<i>A street in Flourens, the house of the late
Jean Munier, tailor, in the foreground.</i></h3>


<p>Flourens was a little town lying quite out of
the usual route of young English travellers of
rich connections making the "grand tour," and
so, having nothing to recommend it in itself, was
unknown to the great world without&mdash;dull, stupid,
stagnant. Hardly ever a visitor from that
great outside world appeared within the circle of
its hopeless isolation. So it was a very strange
thing to the town when one morning a great
coach, as big as a house, dragged by four horses,
with postilions clad in scarlet faced with blue,
their legs incased in huge jack-boots, and each
with a club queue as thick as his wrist hanging
down his back, came whirling, rattling, lumbering,
in the midst of a swirling cloud of dust, into
the silence of the town. It was twice wonderful
when the coach stopped at the inn, and it was
thrice wonderful when an odd, lean, wizened
little man, evidently the servant, let down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>steps and helped a strange gentleman from within.
He was a tall, dark gentleman, dressed in
black from head to foot&mdash;from the black hat with
the black feather to the black silk stockings.
From the gentleman's shoulder hung a long
black cloak trimmed and lined with black fur,
and Flourens had never seen his like before. He
neither looked to the right nor to the left, but,
without saying good or bad to any living soul, he
and the odd, lean little servant entered the inn,
leaving the crowd that stood without staring and
gaping after him. Then the great coach disappeared
through the arched gate that led to the
stable-yard, but it was a long time before the
crowd began to disperse, before the gossiping began
to cease, before the cloud of silence and dullness
and stagnation settled by degrees upon the
town again. How it was maybe an hour and a
half, and the last of those who had looked and
wondered had gone about their business.</p>

<p>All is quiet, dull, heavily silent again, and in
all the bald stretch of road nothing is to be
seen but two women gossiping at a gate-way,
and a solitary cat upon a garden wall watching
two sparrows chirping and fluttering upon the
eaves.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>It is with this setting that the play opens, and
Oliver Munier, the son of the late Jean Munier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>is discovered leaning against the wall of the
house, basking in the sun, his blouse tucked up,
his hands in his pockets, and a straw in his mouth,
which he now and then chews passively in drowsy
laziness. Within, his mother is busied about
the house-work, now and then rattling and stirring
among the pots and pans, now and then
scolding at him in a shrill, high-pitched voice, to
which he listens with half-shut eyes, chewing his
straw the while.</p>

<p>"I know not," said she, stopping for a moment
in her work that her words might have more
force in the pause&mdash;"I know not whether thou
wert born so, but thou art the laziest scamp that
ever my two eyes saw. Here art thou eighteen
years old, and yet hast never earned a single
sou to pay for keeping body and soul together
since thy poor father died five months ago.
Poor soul! with him it was snip, snip, snip,
stitch, stitch, stitch. There was never a tailor in
Picardy like him. His poor legs were bent like
crooked billets from sitting cross-legged, and his
poor fingers were as rough as horn from the
prick of the needle. Thou lazy vagabond, with
him it was work, work, work."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Oliver, without turning his
head, "it was hard work that killed my poor
father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it was," said his mother; "but it
will never do thee a harm."</p>

<p>Oliver shifted the straw he was chewing from
one side of his mouth to the other. "Very well,"
said he. "Is not one in the family enough to die
of the same thing?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said his mother, and went back to
her work with more clatter than ever.</p>

<p>Just then, at the farther end of the street, the
inn door opened, and the strange gentleman in
black came out, followed first by his servant, and
then by Pierre, the landlord. He stopped for a
moment at the head of a flight of stone steps,
and Pierre pointed, as Oliver thought, towards
their house. Then the strange gentleman came
slowly down the steps, and picking his way
around the puddles where the water from the
trough flowed across the road and followed by
his servant, came down the street towards where
Oliver stood. At his coming a sudden breeze of
interest seemed to awaken in the street. The
two gossips turned and looked after him; the
cat sat up on the wall, and also looked; and the
two sparrows stopped chirping, and seemed to
look. Two or three women appeared at the
door-ways with children; three or four heads
were thrust out at the windows, and Oliver, taking
his hands out of his pockets, removed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
straw that he might see better without the interruption
of chewing.</p>

<p>The strange gentleman, when he had come
to within a little distance of Oliver, stopped, and
beckoning to the little lean serving-man who
followed him, held a short whispered talk with
him. The little lean serving-man nodded, and
then the stranger came straight across the
street.</p>

<p>Oliver gaped like a fish.</p>

<p>"You are Oliver Munier?" said the strange
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver, "I am."</p>

<p>The strange gentleman opened his arms, and
before Oliver knew what had happened, he found
himself being embraced in the open street, with
all those looking on.</p>

<p>"I am thy uncle," said the strange gentleman,
with a gulp, and thereupon, releasing Oliver, he
took a fine cambric handkerchief out of his
pocket and wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>Oliver stood dumb and gaping. He did not
know whether he was asleep or awake. "My
uncle!" he repeated, stupidly, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, thy uncle."</p>

<p>"My uncle!" repeated Oliver again.</p>

<p>"And thy dear mother?" asked the strange
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is in the house," said Oliver; and then
he called, "Mother! mother!"</p>

<p>And his mother, stopping the clattering with
the pots and pans, came to the door, and then,
seeing a strange gentleman, stood quite still and
stared.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Oliver, "here is a man who
says he is my uncle."</p>

<p>"Your what?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"My uncle."</p>

<p>"Your uncle?"</p>

<p>"His uncle," said the strange gentleman.</p>

<p>"I never knew the child had one," said Oliver's
mother.</p>

<p>"What," said the strange gentleman. "Did
Jean Marie never speak of me&mdash;his brother
Henri? Ah me! Well, perhaps he was ashamed
of me, for I was the black-sheep of the flock. I
have been to the Americas ever since I ran away
from home two-and-thirty years ago, and now I
have come back rich&mdash;very rich."</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>At the word "rich," Oliver's mother started as
if she had been stung. "Oliver," she cried, "why
do you stand gaping there like a stupid sot?
You lazy vagabond, bring your uncle into the
house! And you, Monsieur Brother, come in,
come in!" And she almost dragged the strange
gentleman through the door-way. "Brush your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>uncle a chair, Oliver, brush your uncle a chair!
There, Monsieur Brother, that is very good.
Now will you not sit down and rest after having
come all the way from the Americas?"</p>

<p>"My servant&mdash;" began the strange gentleman.</p>

<p>"We have room for him also; we have room
for him as well," said Oliver's mother. "Come,
Monsieur Servant. Oliver, dust him a chair also."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the strange gentleman;
"but it is not that. I had thought that a little
supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He shall have his supper," said Oliver's mother.
"There is enough for him and for all the
rest of us; but no thanks to that son of mine
for that. As lazy a vagabond as ever you saw,
Monsieur Brother. He, too, might have been a
tailor, as was his father; but no, he will not
work. He would rather beg or starve than
work."</p>

<p>"That is of no importance," said the strange
gentleman. "Oliver will have no need to work;
we shall make a gentleman of Oliver. But I was
about to say that I have ordered a little supper
at the inn, and my servant will go and bring it.
Go, Gaspard, and see that all is done well. In
the mean time let us talk over family matters
among ourselves. See, here am I, come, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>said, from the Americas, and without a soul belonging
to me but my servant Gaspard. Let us,
then, all live together&mdash;you, my sister, and Oliver
and me and Gaspard. To-night I will sleep here
in your house. To-morrow Oliver and I shall go
to Paris and choose another lodging, for this is a
poor place for the sister and the nephew of a rich
American to live."</p>

<p>Oliver's mother looked around her. "Yes,"
said she, "that is true. It is a poor place, a very
poor place."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Here is Gaspard with the little supper," said
Oliver's new uncle.</p>

<p>Some one had knocked. Oliver opened the
door, and Gaspard came in, followed by Jacques,
the man from the inn, carrying a great basket
upon his head. Oliver and his mother stared
with open eyes and mouths, for they had never
seen such a little supper as the ugly servant had
fetched from the inn.</p>

<p>"Gaspard saw to the cooking," said the new
uncle. "Gaspard is a famous cook, and I
do not know how I could get along without
him."</p>

<p>Oliver watched the servant furtively, and the
longer he looked the more he felt something that
made his skin creep. The servant was, as was
said, a little thin, wiry man, and he had a lean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
livid face and straight black hair that almost
met the slanting eyebrows; he had a pair of
little twinkling black eyes, mouse-like and cunning;
he had thin, blue, grinning lips that showed
every now and then beneath them a set of large
white teeth; he had a long, sharp chin that stuck
out like that of a punchinello; he was unpleasant
to look at, but then he was a good servant&mdash;yes,
he was a good servant; he might have had
felt upon his feet for all the noise he made, and
he spread the table with only a faint chink or
tingle now and then to show that he was at
work. So Oliver sat watching him from under
his brows, while the new uncle talked with his
mother.</p>

<p>At last Gaspard drew back from the table and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Come," said the new uncle, drawing up a
chair, "let us have supper."</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Second.</span>&mdash;<i>Midnight in Flourens; a flood of moonlight
falling across the bare and naked street, mystic, colorless.</i></h3>



<p>Oliver felt himself rising like a bubble through
the black waters of sleep. A noise, a shrill, penetrating
noise, was ringing in his ears, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>suddenly, as the bubble breaks, he became wideawake
and sat up. At first he did not know
where he was; then he remembered the strange
gentleman&mdash;his new-found uncle&mdash;and knew that
he was in the garret, and that the uncle was
sleeping upon his (Oliver's) bed in the room below.
So recollection came back to his newly
awakened senses by bits and pieces, but all the
while the shrill, penetrating sound rang in his
ears. It was like, and yet it was unlike, the crying
of a cat. It was the same high-pitched, tremulous
strain, like the wailing of an impish baby;
yet there was a difference&mdash;a subtle difference&mdash;between
the crying of a cat and the long-drawn,
quavering, unearthly sound that he heard, voiceless
and inarticulate, in the silent loneliness of
the midnight and the bewilderment of his new
awakening&mdash;a difference that set his limbs to
shaking, and sent the chills crawling up and
down his back like cold fingers.</p>

<p>The sound that he heard neither rose nor fell,
but continued to shrill on and on through the
silence without, as though it would never come
to an end. Then suddenly it ceased. Oliver
sat in darkness upon the garret floor, with the
blankets gathered about his chin, his teeth chattering
and rattling and his limbs shuddering,
partly through nervous, partly through actual
chill. "Chicker, chicker, click!" sounded his teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
loudly in the hush of silence that followed. It
seemed as though that silence was even harder
to bear than the sound itself. "It was only a
cat, it was only a cat," he muttered to himself.
Then, "The devil! there it is again!"</p>

<p>Yes, that same strange noise was beginning
again; at first so faint that Oliver was not sure
that he heard it, then rising higher and higher
and more and more keen. "It is only a cat,
it is only a cat," muttered Oliver, faintly. He
felt his scalp creeping.</p>

<p>Again the noise ceased as suddenly as before
into the same death-like silence.</p>

<p>Some one was stirring in the room below; it
was the American uncle. A great wave of relief
swept over Oliver to find that another besides
himself was awake. The next moment he heard
the window that looked out into the street beneath
softly and cautiously raised.</p>

<p>Near where he lay was an open unglazed window.
It looked out into the moonlight just
above the one that he had heard raised in the
room below. A faint thrill of curiosity began
to stir in the depth of the chaos of his fright.
Strengthened by the companionship of wakefulness,
he crept softly to the square hole and
peered fearfully out.</p>

<p>The houses across the way stood black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
silent against the pale moonlit sky behind. The
street between was bathed in the white glamour.
In the middle of it and facing the house stood
the motionless figure of a woman wrapped in
the folds of a long black cloak. Just below Oliver
was the window that he had heard softly
raised a moment since, and out of it a head was
looking. Oliver could only see the back of the
head, but he knew very well that it was the
American uncle's. He must have made some
noise, for the head suddenly turned and looked
up. He drew back with a keen thrill, afraid&mdash;but
not knowing why he was afraid&mdash;of being
seen. For a while he stood waiting and listening
with bated breath and a beating heart, but
all was silent below. Then again he peeped cautiously
out over the window-sill; the head below
was gone now, but the silent, motionless
figure in the street was yet there.</p>



<p><a name="I018"></a></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">"AT THAT MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>At that moment she looked up, and Oliver
saw her face. It was beautiful, but as livid as
death; just such a face as might utter the sound
that had awakened him to his blind terror. The
eyes were fixed upon him, but not as though
they saw him, and he leaned far out of the window,
gazing fascinated. Presently the thin lips
parted, he saw the white teeth glitter in the
moonlight, and for the third time he heard that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>quavering, unearthly wail break out upon the
night.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of the house beneath opened
noiselessly, and two figures stepped out into the
pale glamour. One was the American uncle, the
other was the clever servant Gaspard. The latter
carried over his arm something that looked
like a long black cloak. At their coming the
sound instantly ceased, and the woman slowly
turned her white ghostly face towards them.
The American uncle strode up to her and caught
her fiercely by the wrist, but she moved no more
than if she had been dead. Oliver saw the
American uncle stand looking this way and that,
like one seeking for some escape; then he looked
at Gaspard. The clever servant was mouthing
and grimacing in a horrible, grotesque manner.
Oliver could see him as plain as day, for the
white moonlight shone full in his lean grisly
face. He opened what he carried upon his arm;
it was a long, black, bag-like hood.</p>

<p>Once again the tremulous, wailing cry cut
through the night, at first faint, then rising higher
and higher and clearer and clearer. Oliver
saw his uncle shudder. Gaspard grinned; he
crouched together, and held the black bag open
in his hands. Oliver heard the American uncle
utter a sharp word that he could not understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and saw him fling the wrist he held away from
him.</p>

<p>What next passed happened in an instant.
There was a leap, a swift, silent, horrible struggle,
and the sound was stilled. Gaspard had
drawn the black bag over the woman's head and
shoulders. Then, without pausing an instant, he
picked her up, flung her limp and helpless form
over his shoulder like a sack of grain, turned, and
with noiseless feet ran swiftly down the street.
Oliver watched him as he ran into an inky shadow,
flitted across a patch of moonlight, disappeared
in a shadow again, appeared, disappeared,
was gone. "My God!" he muttered to himself;
"the bridge and the river are down there.
Would he&mdash;"</p>

<p>When he looked again he saw that his uncle
had gone back into the house.</p>

<p>For a long time the street below lay deserted
in the silence of the moonlight. In the stillness
Oliver could hear the far-away sound of running
water and the distant barking of a dog. He
leaned against the side of the window, watching
with fascinated interest for the return of the
serving-man. At last he thought that he saw a
movement far down upon the moonlit street. It
was Gaspard returning, without his burden. He
appeared, disappeared, passed through the silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
blocks of shadow, of moonlight, of shadow, with
the same swift, noiseless steps, until he reached
the road in front of the house. Then he stopped
short; there was a momentary pause, and then
he looked quickly and suddenly up. It was the
face of a grinning devil from hell that Oliver
saw.</p>

<p>Their glances met; Gaspard's eyes glistened
in the moonlight. That meeting of glances was
but for an instant. The next, Gaspard clapped
his hands to the pit of his stomach, and bending
over, writhed and twisted and doubled himself in
a convulsion of silent, crazy laughter. After a
while he straightened himself again, and as Oliver
gazed, fascinated, he suddenly began an uncouth,
grotesque dance. Around and around he
spun, hopping and bobbing up and down; around,
around, with his black shadow&mdash;pot-bellied, long-limbed,
and spider-like&mdash;hopping beneath him.
So hopping and bobbing, with wagging head and
writhing, twisting limbs, he drew nearer and
nearer to the door. Another leap, and he had
hopped into the house, and the street was silent
and deserted once more in the white moonlight.</p>

<p>For a while Oliver continued leaning out of
the window, dazed, bewildered with what he
had seen. Then he slowly drew his head in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
again, and with trembling limbs and quaking
body crawled back to his blankets that lay in a
heap upon the floor in the darkness. He heard
a distant clock strike two; he would have given
ten years of his life for a ray of good, honest
sunlight.</p>


<h4><i>The Morning.</i></h4>

<p>"Did the cats annoy you last night?" said
Oliver's mother, as they sat at breakfast.</p>

<p>"No," said the new uncle. Gaspard and he
looked as if they had never opened their eyes
the whole night through.</p>

<p>Oliver sat with the untasted breakfast before
him, heavily burdened with the recollection of
what he had seen. For one moment he woke to
the question and answer, and wondered vaguely
whether the little supper of the night before had
given him the nightmare. Then his heart sank
back, heavier than ever, for he knew that what
he had seen he had seen with his waking eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the new uncle looked up. "We
will start for Paris," said he, "at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>Oliver's heart thrilled at the words. It was
on his tongue to say, "I do not want to go to
Paris," but Gaspard's mouse-like eyes were fixed
upon him, and he gulped, shuddered, and sat
silent.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Third.</span>&mdash;<i>Paris.</i></h3>


<p>It was all like the hideous unreality of a
nightmare to poor Oliver. For twelve hours
they had travelled on and on and on, Oliver and
those two dreadful mysterious beings, with only
a brief stop now and then to change horses, and
now and then for a bite to eat. At such times
that one whom Oliver afterwards knew as "the
master," got out and walked up and down, while
the other attended to his duties as servant. But
Oliver always sat still, and shrunk together in
the corner of the coach, weighed down with the
tremendous remembrance of what had passed
the night before, and by no less looming apprehensions
of what was to come. Gaspard always
brought him something to eat, but he had no
appetite for the food, and he shuddered at the
lean, grisly face whenever it appeared at the
door of the coach.</p>

<p>Then again the master would enter, and they
would resume the never-ending journey. At last,
overpowered by the continued intensity of the
strain, Oliver fell into an uneasy sleep, in which
all manner of ugly visions flitted through his
mind. At last the sudden thunderous rumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of the coach over stony streets aroused him
again, and when he awoke it was to find himself
in Paris. He unclosed his eyes and looked stonily
out of the window. He had fallen asleep
while the sun was still quite high in the sky;
now it was night. The lights from the street
lanterns flashed in at the window, traversed the
gloomy interior of the coach, and then flashed
out again; a perpetual glare shone from the windows
of shops and stores; hundreds of people,
passing and repassing, came and went; but poor
Oliver, bewildered and stupefied, saw and felt all
as a part of those dull, leaden dreams that had
disturbed him in his sleep.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he noticed that as they still rumbled
on and on, the lights grew less and less brilliant
and frequent and that the travellers grew less
and less numerous; that the streets grew crookeder
and narrower, and the dark and gloomy
houses upon either hand more ancient and crazy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in a space of darkness, a hand was
laid upon his knee, and a voice spoke his name&mdash;"Oliver!"
He started wide awake, and a keen,
sharp pang shot through him. Just then they
again passed a lantern, and as the light traversed
the interior of the great coach it flashed across
the face of his companion thrust close to his
own. The cloak which he had wrapped around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
him after nightfall had fallen away, his eyes
shone with a strange light, and his lips were
parted with a strange smile. "Were you frightened
at what you saw last night?" he said.</p>

<p>Oliver felt as though a thunder-bolt had fallen.
Twice or thrice he strove to speak, but his
tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and refused
to utter a sound; he could only nod his
head. The very worst thing that he feared had
happened to him. He was so frightened that
it gave him the stomachache. What was to
befall him next? It was through a veil of dizzy
terror that he looked into that face shut up with
him in the narrow confines of the coach. All
had become darkness again; but in the humming
silence the eyeballs of his soul still saw
that strangely smiling face as the eyes of his
body had seen it when the lantern light flashed
upon it. He crouched in his corner, shrunk together
like a rabbit before the face of a serpent.
Again there came another traversing flash of
light, and then he saw that the face had widened
to a grin.</p>

<p>"And you know that I am not your rich uncle
from the Americas?"</p>

<p>Oliver nodded his head once more.</p>

<p>The other began laughing. "Come," said he;
"you are frightened. But I am not so bad as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
you take me to be, or Gaspard either, for the
matter of that, though he has strange habits.
Also you saw what he did last night?"</p>

<p>For the third time Oliver nodded his head.
His throat grew tighter and tighter, and he felt
as though he would choke.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the other. "Then you understand
that Gaspard and I are not to be trifled
with. We are now at the end of our journey,
and there is something that I would have you
do for me. It was for that that I hunted you
up at Flourens, and it was for that that I brought
you here to Paris. If you do my bidding, no
harm shall happen to you; if not&mdash;" The hand
which rested upon Oliver's knee gripped it like
the clutch of a hawk. "Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," croaked Oliver, finding his voice at last.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the other. "Now when we
stop I shall get out first of all, then you, then Gaspard.
He will follow close behind us, and if you
make so much as one noise, one little outcry&mdash;"
The speaker stopped abruptly. They were now
in the black gloom of a crooked, unlighted street,
with high walls beetling upon either side, but
even in the blackness of the gloom Oliver could
feel that the other made a motion with his hands
as though drawing a sack or bag over his head,
and he shrank together closer than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly the coach stopped. The next
moment the door was flung open, and there stood
Gaspard waiting. Oliver's companion stepped
out upon the pavement. "Come," said he, and
there was that in his voice that told Oliver that
there was but one thing to do&mdash;to obey. The
poor lad's legs and arms moved with a jerky,
spasmodic movement, as though they did not belong
to him, and Gaspard had to help him out
of the coach, or else he would have fallen upon
the pavement.</p>

<p>"That is good," said his travelling companion
when he at last stood upon the sidewalk. "Our
legs are cramped by sitting so long, but we will
be better by the time we have walked a little
distance;" and he slipped his hand under Oliver's
arm.</p>

<p>Oliver groaned.</p>

<p>The moon had now risen, and though it did
not reach the pavement, the still pallid light
bathed the upper stories of the houses upon the
other side of the street above the sharp black
demarcation of the lower shadows. They passed
two or three strange spirit-like shapes, ragged
and wretched; but soon leaving even these behind,
and turning down a sudden crooked way,
they came to a dark, lonely, narrow court, utterly
deserted, and silent as death. At the farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>side of this court was a brick wall, black with
moss and mildew. Upon this wall the pallid
moonlight lay full and bright, showing a little
arched door-way that seemed to lead through it
to, perhaps, a garden upon the other side. Here
they stopped, and Gaspard, stepping forward,
drew from his pocket two rusty keys tied together
by a piece of twisted parchment. He
chose one of the keys, and thrust it into the lock
of the gate. The lock was old and rusty. Gaspard
twisted at the key until his bony fingers
were livid, then with a grating noise the key
slowly turned in the rusty lock. The gate opened&mdash;not
into the garden, as Oliver had expected to
see, but into the inky darkness of the passage-way
built into the wall.</p>

<p>"Come, my child," said Oliver's companion.
"Come with me, and Gaspard will follow behind
and close the gate."</p>

<p>Oliver looked about him with helplessly despairing
eyes. Not a soul was in sight but the
two. There was no help, no hope; there was
nothing to do but to follow. He stepped into
the passage-way after the other. The next moment
Gaspard closed the gate, and he found himself
in inky blackness.</p>

<p>"Take my hand and follow," said he who
led; and his voice echoed and reverberated up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>and down the hollow darkness. Oliver reached
blindly out until he touched the unseen hand.</p>

<p>With shuffling feet they moved slowly along
the passage-way for the distance of twenty or
thirty paces, the American uncle leading the
way and holding Oliver by the hand, and Gaspard
following so close behind them that sometimes
it seemed to Oliver that he could feel the
other's hot breath blowing upon his neck. Suddenly
Oliver's guide stopped for a moment, and
Oliver could hear him feeling with his feet upon
the floor in front of him. Then again his echoing
voice sounded, reverberating through the
darkness. "Take care of the steps," said he,
"for they are narrow and slippery."</p>

<p>In answer Oliver felt out instinctively with his
foot. His toe touched the edge of a step, the
first of a flight that led steeply downward into
the darkness.</p>

<p>Down, down they went, Oliver in the middle
and the other behind.</p>

<p>"We are at the bottom of the steps," said the
echoing voice in front of Oliver, and the next instant
he felt the startling jar of missing a step.
Although the blackness was impenetrable, it
seemed to Oliver that they had now reached a
large room, for their footsteps echoed with a
hollow sound, as though from high walls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
a vaulted roof. His guide laid a hand upon his
arm, and at the signal he stopped. Presently he
heard Gaspard fumbling and rustling, and the
next moment a shower of sparks were struck with
flint and steel. As the tinder blazed under his
breathing, Oliver saw that Gaspard leaned over
a small brazen vase that sat upon the ground.
He lighted a match and dropped it into the vase,
and instantly a vivid greenish light blazed up,
dancing now higher, now lower, and lighting up
all the surrounding space. Then Oliver saw that
he was indeed in a high, vaulted, cellar-like apartment,
without window or other entrance than
that through which they had come. In the centre
of this vaulted space, and not far from where
they stood, was a trap-door of iron, to which was
attached an iron ring; a wide, heavy iron bar,
fastened to the floor at one end by a hinge and
at the other by a staple and padlock, crossed the
iron plate, and locked it to the floor. Again
Gaspard drew out the two keys, and fitting the
second into the padlock, gave it a turn. The
padlock gaped. He loosed it from the staple,
and swung back the iron bar, creaking and grating
upon its rusty hinge; then, clutching the
ring in the lid of the trap, he bent his back and
heaved. The iron plate swung slowly and heavily
up, and as Oliver looked down, he saw a glimmering
flight of stone steps that led into the
yawning blackness beneath.</p>

<p>Gaspard reached down into the square hole,
and after fumbling around for a moment, drew
forth an ancient rusty lantern with the end of a
half-burnt candle still in it, which he proceeded
to light.</p>

<p>Then he who was the master spoke again.
"Oliver, my child," said he, smoothly, "down below
there are three rooms; in the farthermost
room of the three is a small stone pillar, and on
it are two bottles of water. Bring them up here
to me, and I will make you so rich that you shall
never want for anything more in this world."</p>

<p>"Am I&mdash;am I to go down there alone?" said
Oliver, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, "alone; but we, Gaspard
and I, will wait here for you."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"Then I will make you rich."</p>

<p>Oliver looked into the face of the other. In
its cold depth he saw something that chilled his
heart to the very centre. He turned, and, leaning
forward, gazed stupidly down into the gaping
hole at his feet; then he drew back. "My God!"
he said, "I&mdash;cannot go&mdash;down there alone."</p>

<p>"But you must go," said the other.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot go alone," said Oliver again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The other turned his head. "Gaspard!" said
he. That was all; but the perfect servant understood.
He stepped forward and laid his hand
upon Oliver's wrist, and his fingers were like
steel wires.</p>

<p>Oliver looked into his face with wide eyes. He
saw there that which he had seen the night before.
"I&mdash;will&mdash;go," said he, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>He reached out blindly a hand as cold as death,
and trembling as with a palsy. One of the others,
he knew not which, thrust the lantern into
it. Then he turned mechanically, and, automaton-like,
began descending the narrow steps.
There were ten or a dozen of them, leading
steeply downward, and at the bottom was a
small vestibule a few feet square. Oliver looked
back, and saw the two faces peering down at
him through the square opening above; then he
turned again. In front of him was an arched
door-way like that through which he had first
come. On the wall around the door-way and
on the floor was painted a broad, blood-red, unbroken
line, with this figure marked at intervals
upon it:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 20%" >
<img src="images/032.jpg" alt="" style="width: 30%" />
</div>


<p>The door was opened a crack. Oliver reached
out and pushed it, and then noiselessly, even in
that dead silence, it swung slowly open upon the
darkness within.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Fourth.</span>&mdash;<i>The three mysterious rooms.</i></h3>


<p>Oliver hesitated a moment, and then entered
the cavernous blackness beyond. There he stopped
again, and stood looking about him by the
dusky glimmer of the lantern, which threw round
swaying patches of light upon the floor and on
the ceiling above, and three large squares of yellow
light upon the walls around.</p>

<p>Oliver wondered dully whether he was in a
dream, for such a place he had never beheld before
in all his life. Upon the floor lay soft,
heavy rugs and carpets, blackened and mildewed
with age, but still showing here and there gorgeous
patches of coloring. Upon the wall hung
faded tapestry and silken hangings draped in
dark, motionless, mysterious folds. Around stood
divans and couches covered with soft and luxurious
cushions embroidered with silk long since
faded, and silver thread long since tarnished to
an inky blackness.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood an ebony table
inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl; above
it hung a lamp inlaid with gold and swung from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the arched stone ceiling above by three golden
chains. Beside the table stood a chair of some
dark red wood, richly inlaid like the table, with
ivory and mother-of-pearl, and by the chair
leaned a lute ready strung, as though just laid
aside by the performer, though the strings, long
untouched, were thick and fuzzy with green mildew.
Upon the chair was a tasselled cushion,
one time rich and ornate, now covered with great
blotches of decay. Upon the table were two
golden trays&mdash;one of them containing a small
mass of mildew that might at one time have
been fruit or confections of some sort; the other,
an empty glass vase or decanter as clear as crystal,
but stained with the dry dregs of wine, and
two long crystal glasses, one of them overset
and with the stem broken. In a dim distant corner
of this one-time magnificent room stood a
draped couch or bed, with heavy hangings tattered
and stained with rot, the once white linen
mildewed and smeared with age.</p>

<p>All these things Oliver saw as he stood in the
door-way looking slowly and breathlessly around
him; then, of a sudden, his heart tightened and
shrunk together, the lantern in his hand trembled
and swayed, for upon the bed, silent and
motionless, he saw the dim, dark outline of a
woman's figure lying still and silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who is there?" he quavered, tremulously;
but no answering voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>As he stood there, with his heart beating and
thumping in his throat, with beads of cold sweat
standing on his forehead, and now and then swallowing
at the dryness in his throat, a fragment
of the hangings above the bed, loosened perhaps
by the breath of air that had come in through
the open door behind, broke from its rotten
threads, and dropped silent and bat-like to the
floor. Oliver winked rapidly in the intensity of
high-keyed nervous strain. How long he stood
there he could never tell, but suddenly the voice
of the master breathed through the stillness behind
him and from above: "Hast thou found
the bottles of water?"</p>

<p>Oliver started, and then, with the same jerky
automaton-like steps with which he had descended
the stone stair-way from above, he began crossing
the room to the arrased door-way which he dimly
distinguished upon the other side of the apartment.</p>

<p>Midway he stopped, and, turning his head,
looked again at the silent figure lying upon the
bed. He was nearer to it now, and could see it
more clearly in the dim yellow light of the lantern.
The face was hidden, but the floating,
wavy hair, loosened from a golden band which
glimmered faintly in the raven blackness, lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>spread in shadow-like masses over the stained
and faded surface of the silken pillow upon which
the head lay.</p>

<p>Impelled by a sudden impulse of a grotesque
curiosity, Oliver, after a moment's hesitation,
crept slowly and stealthily towards that silent
occupant of the silent room, holding his lantern
forward at arm's-length before him.</p>

<p>As the advancing light crept slowly around
the figure, Oliver saw first one thing and then
another. First, the quaint and curious costume of
a kind of which be had never seen before, woven
of rich and heavy silk, and rendered still more
stiff by the seed-pearls with which it was embroidered.
Then the neck and breast, covered by
the folds of a faded silken scarf. Then, as the
light crept still farther around the figure, he saw
it twinkle upon a gold and jewelled object.</p>

<p>Oliver knew very well what it was, and his
knees smote together when he saw it. It was
the haft of a dagger, and the blade was driven
up to the guard into the silent bosom. He raised
the lantern still farther, and the light shone full
in the face. Oliver gave a piping cry, and, stumbling
backward, nearly let fall the lantern upon
the floor. He had seen the face of a grinning
skull gazing with hollow, sightless sockets, into
his own eyes.</p>

</div>
</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>For a while Oliver stood in the middle of the
room, staring with blank, stony horror at the
silent figure. Then for a second time the voice
of the watcher above breathed through the silence&mdash;"Have
you found the water yet?"</p>

<p>Oliver turned stupidly, and with dull, heavy
steps passed through the door-way into the room
beyond, holding the lantern before him.</p>

<p>Here, again, were the same rotting, mildewed
richness and profusion, but they were of a different
character. A long table in the centre of the
room, covered with the remnant of what had
once been a white linen table-cloth, and set with
blackened and tarnished plates and dishes, and
dust-covered goblets, and beakers of ancient cut
and crystal-like glass, showed that it was a dining
apartment into which he had now come.
Two richly-carved chairs, with their indented
cushions, were pushed back as though their occupant
had but just now quitted them.</p>

<p>Oliver felt a wave of relief; here was no silent
figure to frighten him with its ghostly,
voiceless presence.</p>

<p>Upon the other side of this room was another
tapestried door-way similar to that through
which he had just entered. Passing through it,
he found himself in a low, narrow passage, barred
at the farther end by a heavy iron-bound door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>worm-eaten and red with the stain of rust, and
with great wrought-iron hinges spreading out
upon its surface like twisted fingers. Oliver
pressed his foot against it. It was not locked,
and it swung slowly and stiffly open with a dull
groaning of the rusty hinges. Within was a
stone-paved apartment, very different from those
which he had just left.</p>

<p>All around were scattered quaint and curious
jars and retorts of coarse glass and metal. Rows
of bottles of different shapes and sizes stood upon
the shelves, and in the corner was a great heap
of mouldering, dusty books, huge of size, and fastened
with metal clasps. Built into the middle
of the farther wall was a wide brick chimney-place,
black with ancient soot, wherein were several
furnaces of different sizes, all long since cold,
and with the sparks of fiery life dead in their
bosoms. Nevertheless, everything had been left
as though the room had been newly deserted.
One pot-bellied retort reclined tipsily upon its
bed of cold gray ashes; a mortar stood upon the
hob of another furnace with the pestle in it; a
book, held open by a glass rod across the pages,
lay near by, as though for reference.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room stood a square pillar
or table of stone, and upon it were two bottles
containing a clear, limpid liquid, in appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>like distilled water. Each was stoppered with
glass, and sealed besides with a great mass of
blood-red wax. Upon each of the bottles was
pasted a square parchment label. One was
marked in red pigment, thus&mdash;

<img src="images/039a.jpg" alt="Symbol" style="width: 3%"  />.

The other was marked thus&mdash;

<img src="images/039b.jpg" alt="Symbol" style="width: 3%"  />

in black.
Oliver knew that these were the bottles for
which he had been sent.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment; then, reaching forth
his hand, he took first one and then the other,
and thrust them into his pocket.</p>

<p>He had reached the ending of his task.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden it was as though a wave of
renewed life swept over him.</p>

<p>He thought nothing of the greater dangers
that must still await him above, at the mouth of
the trap, though he had there read death in the
master's eyes. He was unreasonably, unthinkingly
elated; it was as though he had reached
the ending of a long nightmare journey, and as
though his face was turned towards the light
again. It was with firmer and less fearful steps
that he retraced his way through the dining-room
and the room beyond, where lay that silent, grisly
sleeper, and so came to the door-way with the
blood-red line drawn around it.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and looked up.</p>

<p>At the square mouth of the shaft he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
two faces still peering down at him, the face of
Gaspard and the face of the master side by side.</p>

<p>Again, and for the third time, the master asked
him the question, "Have you found the bottles
of water?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver, "I have found them."</p>

<p>"Then give them to me," said the other, in a
ringing voice, and he reached his arm down towards
Oliver where he still stood in the door-way,
around which was drawn the blood-red line.</p>

<p>In the reaction from the prostration of fear
which had been upon Oliver for all this time,
in the new elation which possessed him, it was as
though he had come up from out of the dark
waters which had overwhelmed him, and stood
again upon the firm ground of courage.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "very good, my dear American
uncle, but wait a little; what then is to
come of me if I give you these two bottles of
water?"</p>

<p>The other drew back his hand. "Did I not
promise," said he, "to make you rich for as long
as you lived?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver, "you did, but I do not believe
you. Suppose that I give you these two
bottles, how do I then know that you will not
bang down that trap upon me, and lock me in
here to die alone in a day or two?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then come up here," said the other, "if you
are afraid."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver; "but last night I saw something&mdash;"
He stopped short, for the recollection
of it stuck in his throat. "Suppose you should
hand me over to Gaspard and his black bag;"
and he shuddered with a sudden creep at the
thought of it.</p>

<p>The master's face grew as black as thunder,
and his eyes shone blue in the light of the lantern.
"Peste!" he cried, stamping his foot upon
the stone pavement. "Do you chaffer with me?
Will you give me the water, or will you not?"</p>

<p>"No," cried Oliver; "not until you promise to
let me go safe back home."</p>

<p>"You will not give the bottles to me?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment, but only for
a moment. Then there was a snarl like the snarl
of a wild beast&mdash;"Gaspard!" cried the master.
As he cried he leaped forward and down, two
steps at a time, with the servant at his heels.</p>

<p>Oliver ran back into the room, yelling, stumbled
over the corner of a rug, dropped the lantern,
and fell flat upon the floor, where he lay,
with his face buried in his hands, screaming with
terror. In his ears rang a confused noise of
snarls and cries and oaths and scuffling feet, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
no hand was laid upon him. Moment after moment
passed. Oliver raised his face from his
hands, and looked fearfully over his shoulder.</p>

<p>At the open door-way stood Gaspard and his
master, with white faces and gleaming teeth,
dancing and hopping up and down, tossing their
hooked, claw-like hands in the air, foaming with
rage, snarling and gnashing like wolves. The
lantern which Oliver had dropped still burned
with a sickly, flickering gleam, for the candle had
not gone out, and it was partly by the light of it
that he beheld them.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash of lightning, he saw it all:
<i>they could not cross that red line drawn across the
door-way</i>.</p>

<p>Oliver's courage came back to him with a
bound. He sat up and looked at them struggling
and striving to get at him, and kept back as by
an unseen wall of adamant. Instinctively he
reached out and raised the overturned lantern,
for the light was on the verge of flickering out.</p>

<p>"Promise me that I shall reach home safe and
sound," said he, "and you shall yet have the two
bottles."</p>

<p class="center">"AT THE OPEN DOOR-WAY STOOD GASPARD AND HIS MASTER."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The master did not seem to hear him. Oliver
repeated the words. Then suddenly the other
ceased from the violence of his gestures and exclamations,
shook himself, and stood erect, pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>down his lace cuffs, and wiped his face with his
cambric handkerchief. Then he fixed upon Oliver
a basilisk glance, and smiled a dreadful smile.</p>

<p>"Gaspard," said he, "let us go."</p>

<p>He turned and walked up the stone steps again,
closely followed by his servant, and poor Oliver
sat staring stonily after them.</p>

<p>Above, the master gave an order. Oliver heard
a grating, grinding noise. There was a crash
that echoed clamorously through the stillness, a
clanking rattle, a grating screech, a click, and
then the silence of death.</p>

<p>Gaspard had shut and locked the trap-door
above.</p>

<p>Oliver sat dazed and bewildered by the suddenness
of what had happened. Presently he
turned his head mechanically and looked around,
and his eyes fell upon the silent occupant of the
bed.</p>

<p>Then he leaped to his feet, and up the steep
flight of stone steps like a madman. He dashed
his fist against the cold iron lid above his head.
"Open," he shouted&mdash;"open and let me out.
Let me out and you shall have everything. Here
are the bottles of water. Do you not want
them?"</p>

<p>He stopped short and listened, crouching upon
the upper step, close against the iron lid above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
him. He fancied he heard a faint sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>"Let me out!" he screamed again.</p>

<p>Nothing but dead, solemn silence.</p>

<p>Oliver ran down the steps again, the accursed
glass bottles clicking together in his pocket. In
the narrow vestibule below he stood for a moment,
gazing down upon the floor in the utter
abandonment of blank despair. At last he looked
up, and then crawled fearfully forward into the
room beyond, lit by the faint glow of the lantern.
He sat him down upon the floor, and burst out
crying. By-and-by a blind rage filled his heart
against the cruelty of his fate and against the
man who had brought it all upon him. He
sprang to his feet, and began striding up and
down the room, muttering to himself and shaking
his head. Presently he stopped, raised his
clinched fists in the air and shook them. Then
he broke into a laugh. "Very well," said
he; "but you have not got the bottles of water!"
and he felt his pockets; they were still
there.</p>

<p>Then, as he stood there feeling the bottles in
his pocket, the last misfortune of all happened to
him. There was a flare, a sputter, and then&mdash;utter
darkness.</p>

<p><i>The light in the lantern had gone out.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>



<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Fifth.</span>&mdash;<i>The same.</i></h3>


<p>Oliver stood for a while utterly stupefied by
this new blow that had fallen upon him; then,
with his hands stretched out in the darkness
and feeling before him with his feet, he moved
blindly forward. At last he found the lantern
where it stood upon the floor, and kneeling
down he raised the lid and felt within. Even if
he had found a candle, it would have been of no
use to him, for he could not have lighted it, but
nothing was there but the hot, melted grease in
which the wick had expired.</p>

<p>Oliver sat down upon the floor and hid his face
upon his knees. How long he sat there he never
could tell; it might have been seconds, it might
have been minutes, it might have been an hour;
for, like one in a broken sleep, there was to him
no measurement of time.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought flashed upon him, like
light in the darkness: he remembered the chimney
in the room beyond. Why should he not escape
in that way? At the thought a great torrent
of hope swept upon him; his heart swelled
as though it would burst. He rose to his feet,
and feeling blindly in the blackness, came first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the table, and then to the tapestried wall beyond.
Inch by inch, and foot by foot he felt his way
along it, now stumbling over a cushioned couch
in the darkness, and now over the edge of one of
the rugs. So at last he came to the corner of the
room. Thence with out-stretched fingers he felt
his way along over the silent folds of the hangings
until he met the emptiness of the door-way.</p>

<p>In the same manner he crept along the wall
of the room beyond, overturning in his passage
a light table laden with plates and glasses, that
fell with a deafening crash and tinkle of broken
glass. Oliver paused for a moment in the bewilderment
of the sudden noise, and then began
his slow onward way again.</p>

<p>Thus crawling slowly along, and guiding himself
by the walls, he came out through the passage-way
beyond the dining apartment, and so into
the laboratory. Here he had no difficulty in
finding the chimney, for the moonlight shed a
faint, ghostly light down the broad flue above,
glimmering in a pale flickering sheen upon the
bottles and glass retorts that stood around.</p>

<p class="center">"CREEPING CAUTIOUSLY FORWARD, OLIVER CAME TO THE CHIMNEY-PIECE."</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Creeping cautiously forward, Oliver came to
the chimney-place, climbed upon one of the furnaces,
and peered upward. Not twenty feet
above he could see the silvery moonlit sky.
Then his heart sank within him like a plummet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>of lead. For just over his head were grated bars
of iron, thick and ponderous, that, crossing the
chimney from side to side, were built into the
solid brick and stone masonry of the flue. Oliver
clambered down out of the furnace again,
and sat him down upon the edge of it. There
for a time he perched, staring despairingly into
the darkness beyond. "What shall I do next?"
he muttered to himself&mdash;"what shall I do next?"</p>

<p>It could serve no use for him to stay where he
was, among the crucibles and retorts; he might
as well go into one of the other rooms. There, at
least, would be a comfortable place to rest himself,
and he began to feel heavily and stupidly sleepy.</p>

<p>Foot by foot and step by step he felt his way
back again into the farthest room. He gave no
thought to that other occupant, hushed in the silent
sleep of death; but flinging himself down
upon the first couch that he found, gathered the
musty, mildewed cushions under his head, closed
his eyes, and sunk heavily into the depths of a
dark, dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>How long Oliver Munier lay in the blankness
of this heavy sleep he could never know. It
must have been for a great while, as he afterwards
discovered. His waking was sudden and sharp,
and even before he was fairly awake he knew
that he heard a sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened his eyes wide and listened. There
was a soft rustling, a velvety footfall, and the
sound of quick, short breathing, in the silent darkness,
like that of a little child. Finally he heard
a suppressed sneeze.</p>

<p>He sat up upon the couch, and at the noise of
his movements the other sound ceased, only for
the quick breathing.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" whispered Oliver through the
darkness.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the silence was unbroken;
then came a dull, monotonous, musical sound,
somewhat like the humming of a hive of bees,
but rougher and more rattling. Oliver, listening
with all his soul, heard the same rustling footsteps
as before, and now they were coming straight
towards him. There was a moment's pause, and
then something leaped upon the couch beside
him.</p>

<p>Oliver sat as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>He felt a faint breath upon his hand as it rested
upon the cushion at his side, and then something
pressed against his wrist and his arm. It
was soft, warm, furry. It was a cat.</p>

<p>In the gush of relief at this honest, homely
animal companionship Oliver broke down from
his tension of nervous strain to laughing and
crying at once. Reaching out his hand, he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to stroke the creature, whereupon it bowed its
back and rubbed against him in dumb response.</p>

<p>A sudden light flashed upon him. The cat
was alive; it was good honest flesh and blood;
there was nothing ghostly or demoniacal about
it; where it had entered it would have to go
forth again, and where it so passed to and fro
there must be some means of ingress and egress.
Why should he not avail himself of its aid to find
his way out into the daylight again?</p>

<p>In a few moments he had torn the mouldy
silken covers of one of the cushions into small
strips, had twisted these strips into a cord, and
had then tied the cord around the cat's neck.
Wherever the creature went now he would follow
as a blind man follows his dog. He began
to whistle in the excess of his relief at the new
light of hope which had dawned upon him. The
sound awoke shrill echoes in the black vaulted
spaces, and he stopped abruptly. "Very well,"
said he, half aloud. "But nevertheless, my American
uncle, here is a new way out of our troubles."</p>

<p>By force of habit he thrust his hands into his
pocket; the two bottles of water were still there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seemed to Oliver an age before this miraculously
sent conductor, this feline saving angel,
made ready to take its departure. It was hours;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
but there was nothing for him to do but to wait
patiently for the creature to choose its own time
for leaving, for should he undertake to urge it,
it might grow frightened and break away from
him, and so lose him the clew of escape. Yes,
there was nothing to do but to wait patiently
until his guide chose to bestir itself.</p>

<p>Oliver was ravenously hungry, but once or
twice, in spite of the gnawing of his stomach, he
fell into a doze in the dead, monotonous silence
of the place. Nevertheless, through all his napping,
he held tight to the silken cord. It was
from such a doze as this that he was awakened
by feeling a twitching at the silken string, which
he had wrapped around his hand for the sake of
precaution. The cat was stirring.</p>

<p>Oliver loosened the cord so as to give the animal
as much freedom as possible, and then rose
to his feet. The cat, disturbed by his moving,
leaped lightly to the floor. It gave a faint mew,
and rubbed once or twice against his legs. Oliver
waited with a beating heart. At last the
cat started straight across the floor, and Oliver,
holding the string, followed after it. The next
minute he ran against the corner of the table,
stumbled over the chair that stood beside it,
overturning the mildewed lute, which fell with
a hollow, musical crash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The cat had gone under the table, and Oliver
had perforce to go down upon his hands and
knees and follow. When he arose again he was
bewildered, and knew not where he was; he had
lost his bearings in the blank darkness around
him.</p>

<p>The cat had become alarmed, and was now
struggling at the string that held it, and Oliver
was afraid that it would snap the cord and get
away from him. He followed more rapidly, and
the next moment pitched headlong across the
couch in the corner. The silent occupant rattled
dryly, and Oliver heard something fall with a
crash upon the floor, roll for a space, and then
vibrate into silence. "Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!" he cried,
and crossed himself. He knew very well what
it was that had fallen. But the cat was now
struggling furiously, and there was no time to
lose in qualms. He scrambled to his feet, still
holding tight to the silken cord. There was no
trouble now in following the lead of the animal.
The next moment his head struck with terrible
force against the hard stone wall; he saw forty
thousand swimming stars, and for a moment was
stunned and bewildered with the force of the
blow.</p>

<p>When his wits came back to him the cat was
gone, but he still held the end of the silken cord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in his hand. He stooped, and felt the direction
which the cord took. It ran between two of
the lighter silken hangings upon the wall. He
parted them and felt within, and his hand encountered
empty nothingness. He felt above,
below, and on each side, and his touch met the
smooth, cold stones of the wall. The open space
was about two feet high and three feet wide. It
was thence the cat had gone.</p>

<p>Oliver's only chance was to follow after; accordingly
he dropped upon his knees and felt
within. For a foot or more the bottom of the
space ran upon a line of the floor, then it dropped
suddenly and sheerly as the wall of a house.
How far it was to the bottom Oliver had no
means of knowing. He reached down at arm's-length,
but could not touch it. He crawled out of
the hole again, and then reversing himself, went
in feet foremost. He dropped his legs over the
edge of the open space, but still he felt nothing.
Upon either side he could touch the sides of the
passage with his toes; below, they touched nothing.
He dropped himself lower, but still felt
nothing. Lower still, and still felt nothing. He
let himself go to his arm's-length, and hung there
flat against the wall, and felt about with his feet,
but still they touched nothing.</p>

<p>How far was it to the bottom of that black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
passage? If he let go his hold, would he be
dashed to pieces below? A great wave of fright
swept over him, and he struggled vehemently to
raise himself up to the edge of the hole again
whence he had descended, but he was helpless,
powerless. In his frantic struggles his feet clashed
against the sides of the passage-way, but he
could nowhere gain purchase to raise himself so
much as a foot.</p>

<p>His struggles grew fainter and fainter, and at
last he hung helplessly clinging to the edge of
the hole above him with cramped and nervous
fingers. A red light seemed to dance before his
eyes, and he felt his strength crumbling away
from him like undermined earth. He breathed
a short prayer, loosed his hold&mdash;and fell about
six inches to the bottom of the shaft beneath.</p>

<p>He crouched there for a while, weak and trembling
in the reaction from his terror. At last he
heaved a great sigh and wiped the beads of sweat
from his forehead with his sleeve. Then, rousing
himself and feeling about him, he found that the
passage-way continued at right angles with the
bottom of the shaft. It seemed to Oliver that he
could distinguish a faint gray light in the gloom
with which he was enveloped. Nor was he mistaken,
for, crawling slowly and painfully forward, he
found that the light grew brighter and brighter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the passage took an upward turn,
and by-and-by became so steep that Oliver could
hardly struggle forward. At last it again became
level and easy to traverse; and still the
light grew brighter and brighter.</p>

<p>Suddenly the passage-way became horizontal
again, and Oliver stopped in his forward scrambling,
and, sitting helplessly down, began crying;
for there in front of him, a few yards distant,
the gray light of the fading evening shone in at
a square window-like hole, and into it swept the
sweet fresh open air, fragrant as violets after the
close, dank smell of the rooms he had left.</p>

<p>It was through this passage-way that the silent
rooms behind must have been supplied with pure
air. At last Oliver roused himself, and scrambled
forward and through the hole. He found that
he had come through a blank wall and upon a
little brick ledge or shelf that ran along it.</p>

<p>Not far away sat the cat by means of whose
aid he had come forth thus to freedom&mdash;the end
of the silken cord was still around its neck. It
was a black and white mangy-looking creature,
but Oliver could have kissed it in his joy. He
reached out his hand towards it and called to it,
but instead of answering it leaped from the brick
ledge to the pavement beneath, and the next moment
had disappeared into a blind alley across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the narrow court upon which Oliver had come
through the hole in the wall.</p>

<p>Oliver sat for a moment or two upon the brick
ledge, looking about him. Across the way was
a high windowless wall of a house, and below
that, at a considerable distance, a low building
with a double row of windows extending along
the length of it. Close to him was a narrow
door-way&mdash;the only other opening in the wall
through which he had just come. The ledge
upon which he sat ended abruptly at that door-way.
Above him, and at the end of the alley-way,
was another blind windowless wall. All
this Oliver observed as he sat upon the ledge,
swinging his heels. Then he turned and dropped
lightly to the pavement beneath. Something
chinked in his pocket as he did so; it was the
two bottles of water.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" said Oliver, heaving a sigh.
"I am safe at last."</p>

<p>There was a sharp click of the latch of the
door near to where he stood, and then it opened.
"Good-day, monsieur," said a familiar voice.
"Your uncle waits supper for you." It was
Gaspard, the servant, who stood in the door-way,
bowing and grimacing respectfully as he held it
open.</p>

<p>Oliver staggered back against the wall behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
him, and there leaned, sick and dizzy. Presently
he groaned, sick at heart, and looked up and
down the length of the narrow street, but not another
soul was in sight; there was nothing for
him to do but to enter the door that Gaspard
held open for him.</p>

<p>"Straight ahead, monsieur," said Gaspard,
bowing as Oliver passed him. "I will show you
to your uncle, who is waiting for you." He
closed the door as he spoke, and, as Oliver stood
aside, he passed him with another respectful bow,
and led the way down the long, gloomy passage-way,
lit only by a narrow window at the farther
end.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Sixth.</span>&mdash;<i>The master's house.</i></h3>


<p>At the end of the passage-way Gaspard opened
another door, and then, motioning with his hand,
bowed respectfully for the third time.</p>

<p>Oliver passed through the door-way, and it
was as though he had stepped from the threshhold
of one world into another. Never in his
life had he seen anything like that world. He
turned his head this way and that, looking about
him in dumb bewilderment. In confused perception
he saw white and gold panels, twinkling
lights, tapestried furniture, inlaid cabinets glittering
with glass and china, painted screens whereon
shepherds and shepherdesses piped and danced,
and white-wigged ladies and gentlemen bowed
and postured. A black satin mask, a painted
fan, and a slender glove lay upon the blue damask
upholstery of a white and gold sofa that
stood against the wall&mdash;the mask, the fan, and
the glove of a fine lady. But all these things
Oliver saw only in the moment of passing, for
Gaspard led the way directly up the long room
with a step silent as that of a cat. A heavy
green silk curtain hung in the door-way. Gaspard
drew it aside, and Oliver, still as in a dream,
passed through and found himself in a small room
crowded with rare books, porcelains, crystals, and
what not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<p>But he had no sight for them; for in front of
a glowing fire, protected by a square screen exquisitely
painted, and reclining in the midst of
cushions on a tapestried sofa, clad in a loose,
richly-embroidered, quilted dressing-robe, his
white hand holding a book, between the leaves
of which his finger was thrust, his smiling face
turned towards Oliver&mdash;sat the master.</p>

<p>As Oliver entered past the bowing Gaspard,
he tossed the book aside upon the table, and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, Oliver, my dear child!" he cried. "Is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
then thou again? Embrace me!" and he took
the limp Oliver into his arms. "Where hast
thou been?" And he drew back and looked into
Oliver's face.</p>

<p>"I do not know," croaked Oliver, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Ah! Thou hast been gone a long time.
Thou art hungry?"</p>

<p>"I was," said Oliver, wretchedly; "but I am
not hungry now."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the other; "thou must be hungry.
See! Another little supper;" and he motioned
with his hand.</p>

<p>Oliver had not noticed it before, but there was
a table spread with a white damask cloth, and
with chairs placed for two.</p>

<p>"Let Gaspard show you to your apartment,
where you may wash and refresh yourself, and
by that time the little supper will be ready."</p>

<p>Oliver wondered what all this meant. He
could scarcely believe that the smooth-spoken
master and the quiet and well-trained serving-man
were the same two as those white-faced
demons who had grinned and gnashed at him
across the blood-red line drawn around the door-way
yonder, and yet he could not doubt it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The supper was over, and the master, with his
fingers locked around his glass, leaned across the
table towards Oliver, who, after all, had made a
good meal of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<p>"And those bottles of water," said he. "Did
we then bring them with us from that place
down yonder?" He jerked his head over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>The question was so sudden and so startling
that Oliver sank back in his seat, with all the
strength gone out of his back&mdash;and he was just
beginning to feel more easy. He could not
speak a word in answer, but he nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Then give them to me," said the other, sharply.
And Oliver saw the delicate pointed fingers
hook in spite of themselves.</p>

<p>But Oliver was no longer the Oliver that had
sat on the bench in front of the inn at Flourens
that little while ago; he had passed through
much of late, he had gained wisdom, shrewdness,
cunning. Instead of helplessly handing the two
phials over to the other, as he might have done
a few hours before, he suddenly pushed back his
chair, and rose to his feet. Not far from him
was a window that looked out upon the street; he
stepped quickly to it, and flung it open. "Look!"
he cried, in a ringing voice. "I know you now&mdash;you
and your servant. You are devils! You
are stronger than I, but I have some power."
He drew forth the two bottles from his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"See!" said he, "here is what you have set your
soul upon, and for which you desired to kill me.
Without you promise me all that I ask, I will
fling them both out upon the pavement beneath.
And what then? They will be broken, and the
water will run down into the gutter and be gone."</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence, during
which Oliver stood by the open window with
the two phials in his hand, and the master sat
looking smilingly at him. After a while the
smile broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Come, Oliver," said he, "you have learned
much since I first saw you at Flourens. You
are grand in your heroics. What, then, would
you have of me, that you thus threaten?"</p>

<p>Oliver thought for a moment. "I would have
you let me go from here safe and sound," said he.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the other. "And what else?"</p>

<p>"That you promise I shall suffer no harm
either from you or your servant Gaspard."</p>

<p>"Very good. And what else?"</p>

<p>"That you tell me the secret of that dreadful
place where I have been."</p>

<p>"Very good. And what else?"</p>

<p>"That you show me the virtue of this water."</p>

<p>"Very good. And what else?"</p>

<p>"That you let me have half the gain that is to
be had from it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good. And what else?"</p>

<p>Oliver thought for a moment or two. "Why
this!" said he; "that you tell me why you sought
me out at Flourens, and how you knew that I
had escaped from that pit into which you had
locked me."</p>

<p>"Very good. And what else?"</p>

<p>Oliver thought for another little while. "Nothing
else," said he at last.</p>

<p>Once more the other laughed. "If I refuse,"
said he, "you throw those bottles out of the
window?"</p>

<p>Oliver nodded.</p>

<p>"And you know what would then happen?"</p>

<p>Oliver nodded again.</p>

<p>"And if I promise," said he, "what then?"</p>

<p>"I will give to you those bottles that you seek,"
said Oliver.</p>

<p>"But what shall I promise by? My honor?"</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head.</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Do you not trust that?"
said he. "No? By what, then, shall I promise?"</p>

<p>A sudden flash of recollection passed through
Oliver's mind, a sudden inspiration came to him.
"Promise by this," he cried, in a ringing voice&mdash;


<img src="images/061.jpg" alt="Symbol" style="width: 3%"  />.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>and he drew the figure which he had seen depicted
upon the red line around the door-way at
the bottom of the stone steps&mdash;the line that had
kept back Gaspard and his master like a wall of
adamant. The other's face grew as black as thunder.
There was a sharp click&mdash;he had crushed
the glass in his hand to fragments. A drop of
blood fell from his palm upon the table-cloth,
but he did not seem to notice it.</p>

<p>"Promise by that?" said he, a little hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver; "by that sign."</p>

<p>The other swallowed as though a hard lump
were in his throat. "Very well," said he; "I
promise."</p>

<p>Oliver saw that the promise would be kept.
He closed the window near to which he stood.
When he turned around, the other's face was
smooth and smiling again.</p>

<p>"And now sit down," said he, "and let us finish
our little supper, then I will tell you the story
of those rooms yonder, and of the dead lady
whom you found there."</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS CHAMBERS.<br />


<small>A MONOLOGUE BY THE MASTER.</small></h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The master drew his chair a little more around
towards the fire, and drawing a gold toothpick
from his waistcoat pocket, settled himself comfortably.
"Did you ever hear," said he, "of a
certain Spaniard, a very learned man, a great
philosopher, and a renowned alchemist, named
Raymond Lulli?"</p>

<p>"No," said Oliver; "I never heard tell of
him."</p>

<p>"Or of Arnold de Villeneuve, the great French
doctor, also a renowned alchemist?"</p>

<p>"No," said Oliver, "nor of him either."</p>

<p>"Well, that is not surprising; your attention
has not been called to such matters, and they
died more than four hundred years ago. Nevertheless,
the history of the room you saw down
yonder relates to them, and I am about to tell
you the story of it as well as I know it.</p>

<p>"It was luck or chance or fate, or whatever
you call it, that first turned Raymond Lulli's attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>to alchemy. At the time he was studying
Arabic in the mountains of Aranda, at the
shrine of St. James de Castello.</p>

<p>"When his mistress, the beautiful Ambrosia
de Compastello died, Raymond Lulli took it into
his head to follow a droll fashion sometimes
practised in those musty old days. He made a
vow&mdash;perhaps rather hastily&mdash;to devote the rest
of his life to religion; to spend it in converting
Mussulmans to what was called the true faith.
So, to prepare himself, he began studying Arabic
in the mountains of Aranda.</p>

<p>"One day the Father Superior sent to him a
great chest of Arabian books which had just
been received at the convent. Among them was
a curious little volume, square and bulky, which
was not written in Arabic, but in characters of a
kind which Raymond had never seen before, and
which somewhat resembled Hebrew. Upon the
first page of the book was a picture, and upon
the last page was another. The first represented
a flower with a blue stalk, red and white blossoms,
and leaves of pure gold, which stood upon
a mountain-top, and was bent by a gust of wind
which blew from a blood-red cloud. Around the
flower was a circle of open eyes. Above this
circle was a naked hand holding a sword transversely
by the blade. Below was a heart transfixed
by what appeared to be a long pointed nail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
or spike. The picture upon the last page of the
book represented a king with a golden sword in
the act of killing a naked child, and a beautiful
winged figure catching the blood in a crystal
vase. At the head of the first page of the text
of the book were three rubricated Arabic words.
Below the last page of the text were three Hebrew
words, also in rubrics. All six words had a
meaning, but it is not necessary to tell you what
they were or what they were intended to signify.</p>

<p>"Now it chanced one day that Raymond was
reading a volume written by one Abou Ben Hassan,
surnamed Al Sofi, or the Wise. The manuscript
had been sent to him by the Father Superior
in the same case with the curious little volume
of which I have first spoken. This work of the
learned Ben Hassan was written upon the subject
of hermetic philosophy. In it was one passage
upon which Raymond Lulli happened, and which
altered the whole course of his life. The author
was descanting upon the learning and wisdom of
Hermes Trismegistus, of whom, Oliver, it is altogether
likely that you never heard. The passage
itself ran somewhat thus (I have often read it
myself): 'Since that time, so the words ran, hath
never a man lived so wise as Hermes Trismegistus,
saving only the great Geber (so called by the
Christians, but whom the learned among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
faithful knew better as Abou Moussah Djafar),
who was, indeed, the ripest apple from the flowery
tree of learning. He it was who wrote that
great thesis, which, did it now exist (for it is, alas!
lost to the world), and did there live a being possessed
with deep and sufficient knowledge to read
the same, would more enrich him who could interpret
it, both with knowledge and with wealth,
than any one who hath ever lived since the days
of King Solomon. It would, moreover, teach him
a knowledge of that by means of which he might
prolong his life to a thousand years, if he so chose
to prolong it. For the great Geber had collected
with infinite pains and ripest study the wisdom
hidden in the tombs and mountains of farther
Egypt, and had in his work explicated those
two mysterious arcana which the wisdom of
ages hath striven in vain to penetrate, to wit,
the secret of life and the secret of wealth. Yea,
not even the great Hermes Trismegistus himself
was able to solve those two questions,
which are, indeed, the fruition of all learning&mdash;the
attainment of unfailing life and of infinite
wealth.</p>

<p>"'But even were that volume, in which lieth
hidden those tremendous secrets, to fall into the
hands of man at this day, who at present now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>liveth could read or interpret it, or could understand
a single one of those mysterious sentences
of his wherein lieth hidden the secrets of
life and wealth? For hath not the great Geber
himself said, "He who would understand must
first climb the mountain of difficulty, and pluck
from the blue stem the red and white blossoms?"
Hath not he also said, "He must, last of all, drink
the blood of the infant from the crystal cup of
the king and the seraphim?" And who liveth
now that could understand these words, much
less accomplish that task which he hath set as a
bar across the path-way of knowledge&mdash;to pluck
that flower and to drink that blood?'</p>

<p>"Such, my dear Oliver, are, as near as I can
recollect, the very words of the learned Abou
Ben Hassan. Conceive, if you can, their effect
upon Raymond Lulli. It was as though a thunder-bolt
had fallen at his feet, and as though he
beheld a great truth by the flash of light that
accompanied it. That volume of the wise Geber,
that repository of the two great secrets of the
world, had fallen into his, Raymond Lulli's, hands
as though blown there by the wind of fate.</p>

<p>"Now, at that time the most learned man in
Europe, perhaps the most learned in the world,
was Arnold de Villeneuve. He was the most
skilful physician and the greatest scholar of his
day, and was in the very height and prime of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
powers. Raymond Lulli determined to apply to
him for a solution of the mysteries of the little
volume, and thereupon set out at once for Paris
to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, one morning, as Arnold sat in
his cabinet engrossed in his studies, there came
a rap upon the door. It was the servant, who
announced a stranger below. The doctor bade
the servant show him in. It was Raymond Lulli,
dusty and travel-stained.</p>

<p>"As soon as the servant had quitted the room,
he came close to the table at which Arnold sat,
and addressed him in the grandiloquent way of
the day, somewhat in this fashion: 'I have come
a long and weary way, I have taken a bitter and
toilsome journey to seek you, and to beseech of
you to give me one little measure from your
great storehouse of wisdom and learning.' So
saying, he thrust his hand into his bosom and
brought forth the little volume, wrapped carefully
in the folds of a linen cloth. He opened it,
and held it before the eyes of Arnold de Villeneuve.
'Tell me, master,' said he, 'in what language
and with what characters is this little
volume written?'</p>

<p>"Arnold laughed. 'It is written in ancient
Chaldee, my son,' said he. 'And have you, then,
sought me out to answer you such a question as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that? There are many other scholars in Europe
who could have told you as much.'</p>

<p>"'No, master,' said Raymond; 'it was not
alone for that that I sought you, for, as you
say, there are others that could have told me as
much; but who save you could unfold to me the
meaning of this?' And he opened the book at
the first picture representing the flower upon
the mountain-top. 'And who but you, the great
Arnold de Villeneuve, could teach me how to
climb the mountain of knowledge and pluck the
flower of wisdom? Will you teach me that,
master?'</p>

<p>"Arnold de Villeneuve said nothing at all, but
his face had grown all at once very white. By-and-by
he drew a deep breath. 'I will try to
teach you the secrets of that book,' said he, after
a while; 'but it will be a long and weary task,
for I have first to learn very much myself.'</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>"That morning at dinner-for they used in
those days, Oliver, to dine at ten or eleven o'clock
in the morning&mdash;Raymond Lulli saw for the first
time Agnes de Villeneuve, who was then reputed
the most beautiful woman in Paris. It was no
wonder that, fresh from the ennui of the solitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the mountains of Aranda, he should have fallen
passionately in love with her. Neither was it
strange that Agnes should love him. For this propinquity,
Oliver, is a droll affair. It will cause a
woman to fall in love with a ghoul, not to speak
of one so tall and handsome as Raymond Lulli.
So she loved him as passionately as he loved her.
It was as natural as for steel and loadstone to
come together.</p>

<p class="center">"SUCH WAS THE WORKSHOP IN WHICH THE TWO LABORED TOGETHER."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>"In the days and weeks that followed, Arnold
de Villeneuve saw nothing of what was passing
between the two. In his eyes Raymond Lulli
was but a fellow-student. It did not occur to
him that passion might find place even in the
bosom of such an ardent follower of alchemy as
this new scholar of his. He beheld only the
philosopher and student; he forgot the man.
For months the two labored and toiled like
slaves, striving to discover those two secrets contained
in the great Geber's book, and hidden beneath
the strange formulas, the obscure words,
and the mystic pictures. One day they seemed
upon the very edge of success, the next day they
failed, and had to begin again from the very beginning.
The laboratory in which they conducted
their great work was one in which Arnold de
Villeneuve had already carried forward and completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>some of his most secret, delicate, and successful
operations. Within the wall of the garden
back of his house he had had a hollow
passage-way constructed, which ran for some little
distance to the deep cellar-like vault that had,
perhaps, at one time been the dungeon of some
ancient fortress. Beneath this vault or dungeon
were three rooms, opening one into another, that
had in a far distant period been hewn out of the
solid rock. They were the rooms from which
you, Oliver, escaped only a little while ago. Two
of those rooms were sumptuously and luxuriously
furnished; the furthermost was the laboratory
where the two great problems were solved&mdash;the
problem of life and the problem of wealth. Such
was the workshop in which the two labored together,
occasionally for days at a time; the one
sometimes sleeping while the other compounded
new formulas or watched the progress of slow
emulsions.</p>


<p>"It was, as Arnold de Villeneuve had predicted,
a long and toilsome labor which they had undertaken;
it was, as the great Geber had said,
a tremendous task to climb the steep mountain
of knowledge and to pluck the mystic flower of
wisdom from the top. But at last the summit
was reached. Suddenly, one morning, unexpected
success fell upon them like a flash of lightning;
for this, like many other successes, happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>through an accident-the overturning of a phial
(the contents of which it had taken months to
prepare) into a mortar in which Raymond was
mixing a powder. It all happened in a moment-the
accidental brushing of a sleeve-but that
one moment was sufficient; the secret of life was
discovered. From the secret of life to the secret
of wealth was but a step; the one hung upon
the other. The very next day they discovered
that which shall make us-you, Oliver, and me,
whom you may henceforth call 'master'-the
richest men in France. Did you know that the
diamond and the charcoal are the one and the
same thing?"</p>

<p>"No," said Oliver, "I did not; the one is black
and the other is white."</p>

<p>Oliver's companion laughed. "There is less
difference between black and white, Oliver, and
between the charcoal and the diamond, than most
people think. Later you will learn that for yourself;
just now you must take my word for it.
But to resume our narrative. The next morning
Raymond and his master, as I have said, produced
from the first formula a second, by means
of one drop of which they created in a closed
crucible, in which five pounds of charcoal had
been volatilized, a half-score of diamond crystals
of various sizes, and one fine blue-white crystal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>of nearly eight carats in size. Oliver," cried the
speaker, rising in his enthusiasm, and striding up
and down the room, "that was, to my belief, the
greatest discovery that the world ever saw!
Other philosophers have approached the solution
of the problem of life, and have prolonged their
existence ten, twenty, yes, fifty years; still other
philosophers have transmuted the baser metals
into gold; but who ever heard of transmuting
black charcoal into brilliant diamonds?" He
stopped abruptly and turned towards the lad,
and Oliver saw the eyes which looked into his
blaze with excitement, like the diamonds of which
he spoke. "Do you wonder," he cried, "that
Raymond Lulli and his master acted like madmen
when they opened that retort, and found
those sparkling crystals twinkling like stars upon
the rough surface of the metal? Ha!"</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>"But, as I said, it was a long time before those
experiments were concluded&mdash;before the great
problems of life and wealth were solved. Nine
months had passed since Raymond had come,
dusty and travel-stained, like a beggar to the
master's door, asking for crumbs of knowledge.
It was the consummation of their life's success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
The very next morning after that consummation
came ruin. A blow, sharp and terrible, fell upon
the house.</p>

<p>"It was late, and the master had not yet made
his appearance. Raymond Lulli, passing along
the hall-way with a book under his arm, met
Agnes at a door-way.</p>

<p>"'My father,' said she, 'has not yet come down
from his room.'</p>

<p>"'I will call him, Agnes,' said Raymond, and
then she noticed that his face was as pale as ashes.</p>

<p>"'Are you ill, Raymond?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;yes, I am ill,' he shuddered. 'I will go
and call your father.' And he turned away.</p>

<p>"Agnes stood watching him as he, with slow,
heavy steps, climbed the steep stairs that led to
the master's room above. She watched him as
he reached the door and knocked; and then,
after a pause, knocked again, and then again;
she watched him as he laid his hand hesitatingly
upon the latch, and then raised it, and pushed
open the door.</p>

<p>"The next moment the heavy book slipped
from under his arm, and fell with a crash to the
floor. 'Agnes!' he cried, 'your father!' And
then his voice rang through the house: 'Jean!
Franquois! Joseph! The master, help!&mdash;the
master!'</p>

<p class="center">"THEY SAW ARNOLD DE VILLENEUVE, THE GREAT MASTER, UPON THE FLOOR."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>"There was a shriek; it was Agnes; there
was a confusion of voices and of running feet,
and when the people of the house crowded into
and around the door-way, they saw Arnold de
Villeneuve, the great master, lying upon the
floor, his eyes closed, and his head resting upon
his daughter's lap, as she kneeled beside him.
His face was white and drawn, and every now
and then he shook with a hiccough. It was
not a pleasant sight, Oliver, and there was no
need to ask the question&mdash;the awful gray veil of
death rested upon the great doctor's face.</p>

<p>"At a little distance from the father and the
daughter stood Raymond Lulli, with a face almost
as ashen white as that of the dying man.
He turned to the frightened servants.</p>

<p>"'Why do you stand there like fools?' he cried.
'Come, lift the master upon his bed.'</p>

<p>"They approached at Raymond's bidding, and,
raising the dying physician, laid him back upon
the bed, from which he had apparently just risen
when the stroke of death fell upon him.</p>

<p>"Minute after minute passed in dead silence,
broken only now and then by a suppressed sob
from one of the servants who stood around.
Agnes sat upon the bedside, silently holding her
dying father's hand in hers. Half an hour went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>by&mdash;an hour&mdash;the end was very near. Then suddenly
Arnold opened his eyes; they were sightless
to this world; they were gazing straight into
the shadow of eternity that hung like a curtain
before him. His lips moved, and at last a struggling
sound passed them.</p>

<p>"'Agnes!' said he, in a thick, guttural voice.
"'Agnes!'</p>

<p>"'Here I am, father,' said she, and she leaned
forward, bringing her face before his eyes; a
gleam of intelligence flickered faintly in them.
He beckoned stiffly, and Agnes drew still nearer.
The dying man raised his hand and touched her
face; he felt blindly for a moment, passing his
cold, leaden fingers over her brows, and at last,
as though finding her eyes, pressed his palm upon
them. He held his hand there for a few seconds,
and then let it fall heavily beside him, and those
who looked saw Agnes's eyes were now closed.
For a moment or two there was a pause of dead
silence.</p>

<p>"It was Arnold's voice, thick, guttural, inarticulate,
that broke the hush: 'Look!'</p>

<p>"Agnes opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Arnold raised his hand, and with his forefinger
began feebly drawing strange figures in
the air; at first stiffly, then gradually more freely
as he gathered his dying powers into one last
effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"At first Agnes gazed at the slow-moving
hand intently, wonderingly. Raymond sat near
by, with his chin resting upon his palm and his
eyes fixed upon the floor, brooding darkly. By-and-by
those who watched saw the color fade
slowly out of her cheeks; they saw her face
grow pinched and her eyes dilate. At last she
reached out her hand and laid it upon her father's,
holding it fast in spite of his stiff and feeble
efforts to release it.</p>

<p>"'Stop, father!' she cried. 'Oh, God! Stop,
I can bear no more.'</p>

<p>"'Look,' said Arnold, thickly.</p>

<p>"He had released his hand, and now again began
drawing figures in the air. All were looking
at him wonderingly, excepting Raymond
Lulli, who never once raised his eyes, fixed broodingly
upon the floor. At last the motions ceased,
and the hand fell heavily upon the bed beside
the dying man. Agnes sat silent, looking into
his face with a face as white. At last she spoke,
in an unsteady, constrained voice.</p>

<p>"'Father,' said she, 'is there nothing else?
Must I do that?'</p>

<p>"No answer.</p>

<p>"'Father,' said she again, 'must I do that?'</p>

<p>"Agnes waited for a little while, then again
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Father, must I do that? Is there nothing
else? Must I do that?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"There was another space of breathless silence,
and then one of the women began to cry; the
others joined in with her. Arnold de Villeneuve
was dead.</p>

<p>"Agnes arose from the side of the bed where
she sat, and, without saying a word, walked slowly
and stiffly out of the room.</p>

<p>"That same afternoon her waiting-woman
came to Raymond Lulli, and told him that her
mistress wished to speak with him. He followed
the woman up the long flight of steps to the
door of Agnes's chamber. He knocked, and
heard a faint voice within bid him enter. Agnes
was standing in the centre of the room, clad in
a dark rich dress, heavily embroidered with seed-pearls.
Her dark hair was gathered loosely behind
by a golden serpent which held the locks
together. There were no signs of tears upon her
pale face, but her eyes were encircled by dark
rings.</p>

<p>"Raymond stood for a moment looking at her.
'Agnes!' he cried, and then came forward into
the room, and took her into his arms. She neither
yielded nor resisted, but stood passive and
motionless. There was something about her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
struck a chill through him; he drew back, and
looked into her face. 'Agnes,' he said, 'what is
it? Are you ill? Do you not love me?'</p>

<p>"There was a moment's pause. 'Yes,' said
Agnes, 'I love you.'</p>

<p>"Again Raymond took her in his arms, but
still there was no response.</p>

<p>"Suddenly she laid her hand upon his breast,
and drew a little back. 'Tell me,' said she&mdash;'tell
me, Raymond, is there in this house a little crystal
globe in a silver box?'</p>

<p>"Raymond hesitated. 'Yes,' said he.</p>

<p>"Agnes's lips moved as though she said something
to herself. Then she spoke again: 'And
tell me one thing more, did not you and my father
discover a clear liquor by means of which
you could become richer than any one in France
or in the world?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Raymond. Again he saw Agnes's
lips move.</p>

<p>"'And tell me,' said she; 'have you not a book
written in strange characters, and illuminated
with two strange pictures?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Raymond.</p>

<p>"Again, for the third time, Agnes moved her
lips, and this time Raymond heard the words
which she whispered to herself: 'Then it is true.'</p>

<p>"'What is true, Agnes?' said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"She did not seem to hear his question. 'Tell
me this, Raymond,' said she, 'did not you and my
father work together in a dark vaulted place under
the ground?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Raymond.</p>

<p>"Agnes paused for an instant. 'Then take me
there, Raymond,' said she.</p>

<p>"For a moment or two Raymond could not
speak for surprise. 'What?' he cried. 'Take
you there? Take you there now, at this time?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, now.'</p>

<p>"'Agnes, I do not understand.'</p>

<p>"'It is of no importance that you should understand,'
said she; 'only I have something to
show you there that you have not yet seen, and
of which you know nothing.'</p>

<p>"You know the path they took, Oliver; you
yourself walked along it at my heels the other
day. Agnes and Raymond traversed that same
passage, descended the same stair that you descended,
entered the vault that you entered.
There Raymond Lulli unlocked the padlock and
raised the trap-door as you saw Gaspard unlock
the one and raise the other. He took the same
lantern from the shelf within as Gaspard took it,
and lit the candle as Gaspard lit it, then descending
the stairs, they entered the first of the three
rooms below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Raymond lit the lamp that you found hanging
there from the ceiling, and Agnes stood for
a moment looking around her. The tapestries
and hangings and all that you saw were fresh
and beautiful then.</p>

<p>"They entered the room beyond where were
the remains of the supper that Raymond and his
master had eaten the night before; the chairs by
the table pushed carelessly back as they had left
them, and as you, Oliver, found them.</p>

<p>"Thence they passed through the narrow passage,
and entered the laboratory beyond, where
Agnes saw the two sealed phials standing upon
the stone table as you saw them.</p>

<p>"Agnes pointed with her finger towards them.
'And that,' said she&mdash;'that, then, is the precious
liquor of wealth that you and my father discovered?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Raymond.</p>

<p>"'And it can transmute charcoal to diamonds?'</p>

<p>"Raymond hesitated. 'Yes,' said he.</p>

<p>"Agnes turned suddenly upon him. 'And tell
me, Raymond,' she said, 'have you not that little
crystal globe in the silver casket?' Raymond
instinctively raised his hand to his breast. 'I
see you have,' said she, smiling. 'It contains the
secret of life?'</p>

<p>"Raymond nodded his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was a pause; then Raymond said, in a
hoarse voice, 'Why do you question me thus,
Agnes? Do you not love me?'</p>

<p>"Agnes looked upon him with the same strange
smile that her lips had worn ever since she had
begun questioning him. 'Poor Raymond,' said
she, 'do you, then, doubt my love? But tell me,
have you not with you that book of knowledge,
of which I spoke to you, containing the strange
pictures?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Let me see it;' and she held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Raymond hesitated. Agnes fixed her beautiful
eyes upon him. 'Do you not love me, then?'
said she.</p>

<p>"Raymond thrust his hand into his bosom, and
drew from the pocket of an inner vest the little
volume.</p>

<p>"Agnes took it, and look curiously at it. 'Raymond,'
said she, 'will you give me this book for
my own, to do as I choose with it?'</p>

<p>"Raymond made no answer.</p>

<p>"'You will not? Do you, then, love it more
than me?' She stood holding the book, waiting
for his reply.</p>

<p>"'I give it to you, Agnes,' said he at last.</p>

<p>"'And it is now mine to do with as I choose?'</p>

<p>"'It is yours.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Give me the lantern.'</p>

<p>"Raymond reached it to her wonderingly.
She took it, raised the slide, opened the book,
and held the parchment leaves over the flame
within. Raymond gave a sharp cry, 'Agnes!'
He would have snatched it from her, but she
laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"'Stop!' said she. 'Have you not all that man
can desire in this world without this book? You
have given it to me; it is mine, and I shall do as
I choose with it. You cannot love it with all
your heart and me also. Which do you choose?'</p>

<p>"She had held the book to the flames while talking,
her eyes fixed intently upon it as the parchment
leaves blackened and curled and wrinkled.
Raymond groaned and turned away. The oppressive
odor of the burning skin filled the air,
and when Agnes cast the remains of the volume
into the pit beneath the grate of the furnace, the
wisdom of the great Geber, the learning that had
taken him a lifetime to accumulate, was nothing
but a blackened mass of stinking cinders.</p>

<p>"'Come,' said Agnes, 'let us leave this dark
and dismal place, and go back yonder into the
other room.' She led the way into the first
apartment, and there sat down upon the couch,
motioning Raymond to a seat beside her. 'Are
you happy, Raymond?' said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes,' he whispered. He would have taken
her into his arms, but she held up her hand.</p>

<p>"'Wait,' said she. 'Have you, then, all that
you desire?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said, in a trembling voice; 'with
your love.'</p>

<p>"'Poor Raymond!'</p>

<p>"There was a little space of silence. And then
at last she turned to him with that same strange
smile upon her face. 'Do you know what my
father did when he moved his hands as he did
when you saw him?' said she.</p>

<p>"'No,' said Raymond.</p>

<p>"'He drew strange pictures before my eyes,
Raymond, and I saw them as plainly as I see you
now. Would you like me to tell you what they
were?'</p>

<p>"Raymond nodded his head.</p>

<p>"'Then I shall tell you. I saw you and my
father in this place together, and you had completed
the last of your great experiments, and had
sealed those two phials as I saw them yonder.
I saw you and my father quit this place filled
with joy that the last touch of your work was
done. After that came the dark blank of night
and of sleep. The next picture he drew was of
the morning&mdash;of this morning when he died&mdash;and
I saw him sleeping upon his bed. The door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>opened, and I saw you come softly in and forward
to his bedside, and stand looking down at
him as he slept. Above his face you drew strange
characters with your finger; they were spells
that he himself had taught you. After that I
saw you, Raymond, draw a bunch of keys from
beneath his pillow. Then I saw you go to the
great iron-bound chest that stood in the corner.
From within you took a little silver box; you
did not open the lid, but I saw that within it was
a crystal globe about as large as a dove's egg.
I saw you relock the chest and replace the keys
beneath my father's pillow.' Agnes was looking
into Raymond's face as she spoke, and her lips
still wore that same faint smile. 'What next I
saw, Raymond, was this,' said she. 'You took
from your pouch a little wooden box filled with
a bright green powder; then from the same pouch
you drew a long slender needle. Upon the point
of the needle you took a little of the green powder.
(All this my father drew with his dying
hand in the air, Raymond.) I saw you stoop over
him and thrust that long shining needle deep into
his shoulder. Then you turned and left the room;
but as you left it, I saw your face as I see it now,
and it was as white as ashes, as it is now, and the
sweat stood in beads upon your forehead, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>stands there now. What did it mean, Raymond?'
Her lips never lost that strange, odd
smile.</p>

<p>"'God, I do not know!' cried Raymond,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"'It meant that you murdered my father, Raymond&mdash;that
you murdered the man who taught
you all that you now know&mdash;that you murdered
the man who in nine months made of you, a raw
student, the most learned alchemist, but one, in
Europe.'</p>

<p>"There was a long pause of dead silence. 'Agnes,'
cried Raymond, in that same hoarse, dry
voice, 'Agnes&mdash;I love you!'</p>

<p>"The smile never left her lips. 'Very good,'
said she; 'but stay, I have not yet done. All
that my father had showed me so far was past
and gone; now he showed me what was to come.
I saw us both pass through that long, dark, narrow
way; I saw the dark, vaulted cellar above
us; I saw us descend and stand together in the
farther room yonder and look upon those phials;
I saw myself burning that accursed book by the
light of the candle in the lantern; I saw us seated
together upon this couch as we are now. What
next do you think I saw, Raymond?'</p>

<p>"'I do not know.'</p>

<p>"'I saw this!'</p>

<p class="center">"HE LEANED OVER AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>"There was a movement as quick as lightning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>a flash, a blow, a deep sigh. Agnes sat for a moment
with the smile still resting upon her white
lips, and something bright glistening upon her
bosom. It was the handle of a dagger, and she
had stabbed herself. Then she lay slowly down
upon the pillow beside her.</p>

<p>"For one moment Raymond sat as motionless
as stone; then he started up with a shrill cry.
He leaned over and looked into her face; that
smile was still upon her white lips.</p>

<p>"'Agnes!' he cried; then again, 'Agnes!'
But the smiling lips never answered; she was
dead.</p>

<p>"Raymond slowly turned, and walked heavily
and stupidly out of the place, closing the door
behind him. At the head of the shaft he mechanically
opened the slide of the lantern, and
blew out the half-burned candle, and then set
the lantern upon the shelf within, as he had
been used to do. He closed the trap, and lowered
the bar, and snapped the padlock in the
staple; then, again, with the same slow, heavy
tread, he left the vaulted room, ascended the
stone steps, and threaded the passage-way. He
did not go back into the master's house, but
passed out at the arched gate-way where we,
Oliver, entered. Before he went out into the
street beyond he laid his hand upon his breast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
make sure the silver box containing the talisman
was there; it was all that he had saved
from his ruin."</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>"From that time Raymond Lulli led a wandering,
irregular, eventful life. Under the spur
of his remorse he went first to Rome and then
to Tunis, where, until his life was threatened on
account of his efforts to convert the Mussulmans,
he devoted himself partly to the fulfilment
of his original vow, partly to the further study
of alchemy. After that he lived for a while in
Milan; after that he went to England, where, as
I have heard, he transmuted lead and quicksilver
into gold to the amount of six millions rose nobles;
after that he returned again to Rome; and
after that for a second time to Africa, where he
took up his abode at Bona.</p>

<p>"Now there was at that time at Bona a famous
and learned professor, who had devoted
himself more particularly to the study of demonology.
It is hardly likely that you have ever
heard his name; it was Yusef Ben Djani. I
know of nobody since his time who approached
him in his knowledge of the science unless, perhaps,
it was the great Cornelius Agrippa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"This learned scholar held that the power of
man's will was such that, under certain circumstances,
it could be so far impressed upon those
diffused forces of life about us as to materialize
or concentrate them, and so render them cognizant
to the human understanding, or, in other
words, visible. Now, Oliver, it is very well
known that one man may so impress his will
upon another as to render that other will entirely
subservient to his own. Under such conditions,
the one so impressed sees, feels, smells,
tastes, and senses only as the superior will orders;
he moves, speaks, and exists as the other commands.
If that power, Yusef Ben Djani argued,
could impress material men in this world, why
could it not impress men in the world immediately
beyond? Is not a man, he reasoned, the
same man after quitting this world as when he
lived in the body? Why, then, is he not as subject
to that psychological power there as here,
and why, then, could he not be influenced there
as well as here? Such an influence Yusef Ben
Djani did exert, and succeeded. He materialized
those quiescent forces of life, and brought
them into such communion with himself that he
was able to compel them to that certain exudation
of life in quiescence which we in this world
call matter. Do you understand me, Oliver?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>Oliver shook his head. "No," said he, "I do
not." He had tried to follow the other so far as
he was able, but he had long gotten beyond the
power of comprehension; the words fell upon
his ears one after the other like blows, until his
head hummed like a beehive.</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Very well," said he.
"It is of no importance that you should comprehend
Yusef Ben Djani's theory. But this at
least you can understand: he materialized evil
spirits.</p>

<p>"Now there was a certain young Venetian
student named Nicholas Jovus, who almost from
his childhood had possessed a wonderful psychological
power upon others. By psychological
power I mean the power of superinducing his
own will upon the will of another; in other
words, to make such another do absolutely as
he chose.</p>

<p>"The fame of Yusef Ben Djani was at its
height, and Nicholas Jovus, then about four-and-twenty
years of age, determined to visit the
great master at Bona. The philosopher saw in
the young student the material for an even
greater than himself. He persuaded him to
stay in Bona, and to study the science of demonology
under him. It was while there that, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>the assistance of his master, Nicholas Jovus superinduced
his own will upon the surface of a
mirror to such an extent that within it he could
at any time see that which he willed to see. It
was by means of this mirror that he one time
beheld Raymond Lulli, of whom he had often
heard, and, circumstances being then peculiarly
propitious, beheld at the same time not only
Raymond Lulli himself, but the secret of the talisman
that he carried in his bosom. And not
only did he discover the existence of the talisman,
but (Raymond's mind being at that moment
concentrated upon the past) he discovered
the story of the philosopher's life as I have told
it to you, and thus first gained knowledge of
those dark chambers below the vault. Yes,
Nicholas Jovus saw all this in the mirror just as
I have described it to you, Oliver; it was the
first and only time, but he never forgot it.</p>

<p>"Now soon after Raymond Lulli had reached
Rome, after having left Paris, he was taken with
a violent fever, from which he wakened, his physicians
told him, only to die. But the physicians
were mistaken. The next morning when they
visited him he was sitting at the table eating
a boiled capon, as well a man as you or I. I
need to hardly tell you he had used the talisman
of life.</p>

<p>"Yet it was only with great hesitation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in the last extremity, that Lulli thus rehabilitated
himself with a new body, for by so doing
he cut himself off forever from all chance of entering
those secret chambers again and recovering
the phials, which he now bitterly regretted
having left behind him in the first throes of his
grief and remorse. For Arnold de Villeneuve,
for protection against evil powers, had drawn
around the door of those underground chambers
a circle upon which he had marked a sign that
Raymond Lulli could not pass without leaving
his newly-acquired body behind him.</p>

<p>"From the time that Raymond Lulli had used
the talisman of life to the time that Nicholas
Jovus saw him in the mirror, thirty years had
elapsed, and yet he appeared as young as upon
the day when the Roman physicians had told
him that he was to die.</p>

<p>"Nicholas Jovus determined to gain that talisman
for his own.</p>

<p>"Now the young Venetian student had a curious,
odd servant, very much attached to him,
and not so wicked as one might have thought
under the circumstances. Early one morning,
before the town was awake, Nicholas Jovus, followed
by this servant, left the house of his master
and hurried down to the sea-shore. He had
looked in his glass and saw that Raymond Lulli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was walking there. He met the alchemist not
far from where a long quay ran out into the
water.</p>

<p>"Since the time when he had first seen Raymond
Lulli in the glass, Nicholas Jovus had
made the acquaintance of the master in his own
proper person. Accordingly, Raymond stopped
and chatted awhile with the young student.
While the two stood talking together that odd
servant of whom I spoke stepped around behind
the philosopher. He made a silent motion of
inquiry, Nicholas Jovus nodded in reply, and the
next moment all was over. The serving-man
had&mdash;had drawn a bag over the philosopher's
head.</p>

<p>"Nicholas Jovus thrust his hand into the philosopher's
bosom, and, after feeling for a moment,
found the talisman, which was enclosed in
a bag hung around his neck. He did not take
time to unfasten the cord from which it hung,
but, giving it a jerk, broke the string with a
snap.</p>

<p>"As he did so, Raymond Lulli, who had been
lying silent in the encircling arms of that strange
servant, gave a sharp, a loud, and a bitter cry.</p>

<p>"What followed was as unlooked-for to Nicholas
Jovus as it would have been to you had you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>been there, Oliver. That quaint servant of his&mdash;what
think you he did? He laid Raymond Lulli
upon the sand of the sea-shore, and stripped the
false body off of him as you might strip off a
man's coat. The young student did not know
how it was done, but done it was, and as deftly
and as cunningly as a fisherman might draw the
skin from an eel. Then, as Nicholas Jovus stood
aghast watching him, he shouldered what appeared
to be the empty skin of Raymond Lulli,
turned, and running some distance out along the
quay, flung his burden with a splash into the water.
It sunk like a stone. The Raymond Lulli
that was left behind was an old man of seventy-five
years of age, bruised, bleeding, dying. My
faith, Oliver! It was a long time before Nicholas
Jovus could bear the presence of that odd
servant of his without a shudder.</p>

<p>"That is all concerning the story of Raymond
Lulli and those rooms that you were in not long
ago."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">THE END OF THE MASTER'S MONOLOGUE.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He finished speaking, and Oliver sat gazing
at him open-mouthed. He was bewildered&mdash;he
was stunned. It began to dawn upon his stupefied
wits that he was in the very presence of and
face to face with a dreadful, grotesque miracle.
"And you," said he, in a low voice, and then
stopped short, for the question stuck in his
throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The other smiled. "And I?" said he. "What
is it, then, that you would ask?"</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are you&mdash;are you&mdash;Nicholas Jovus?"</p>

<p>The other laughed. "What a droll question!"
said he. "That thing happened four hundred
years ago."</p>

<p>Oliver's skin began to creep; but then he was
growing used to that feeling. The two sat
watching one another for a little while in silence,
the one with dull bewilderment of wonder,
the other smiling oddly. Presently the smile
broke into a laugh. "You are very droll, Oliver,"
said he; "you would believe anything that
I told you. I have seen and done many strange
things in my days, but as for being four hundred
years old&mdash;Bah! my child, why all this that I
have been telling you is only a story, a legend,
a tradition, handed down from one to another
of us who dabble in alchemy; for I confess to
being one of such. No doubt it has grown
absurdly as it has been transmitted from man
to man. Nevertheless, there are in that story
some strange matters&mdash;one might almost call
them coincidences&mdash;that appear to fit in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
things that you have seen, and which might,
with an irrational mind such as yours, strengthen
absurd speculations." He sat watching Oliver
smilingly for a while. "That mirror of
Nicholas Jovus's," said he, suddenly&mdash;"what
would you say if I had it in my own possession?
Nay, what would you say if it were in this very
room?" Oliver looked sharply around, and again
the other laughed. "You need not be alarmed,"
said he; "it is very harmless. But come, I will
be perfectly frank; it <i>is</i> in this room, and I will
show it to you. It is my intention that we shall
thoroughly understand one another, and we must
arrive at such understanding now. So understanding
one another, we can best be of benefit
to each other. But first of all, since we are in
the way of being frank, I will begin by making
a confession. I confess to you, my dear child&mdash;yes,
I confess frankly that the ugly suspicions
that you have entertained about me have not
been entirely without ground. I confess that I
had not intended that you should have left that
place down yonder, from which you so miraculously
escaped. Perhaps this confession may at
first shock you, but I am sure, when I explain matters,
you will understand that I was not entirely
unjustified in seeking to destroy you. I have, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>think I may say, very considerable skill in foretelling
events by the stars&mdash;not foretelling them
perfectly, of course, for the science of astrology is
not yet perfected, but looking into futurity in a
general way. Nevertheless, imperfect as the science
of astrology is, my reading of fate was clear
enough to teach me who and what you were,
and, in a general way, where you were to be
found. That reading told me that, unless some
heroic remedy were devised, the time drew near
when you would be my ruin&mdash;" he stopped suddenly,
his gaze fixed itself absently above Oliver's
head, and Oliver saw his face grow pale and haggard,
as if it saw some dreadful vision; he drew
in his breath between his shut teeth&mdash;"and my
death," said he, in a low voice, completing his
speech, and shuddering as he spoke the words.
Then he passed his hand over his face, and when
he drew it away again his expression was as
smiling and as debonair as ever. "But we will
not speak of such unpleasant things," said he.
"I have only mentioned them so far that you
might see that I was not altogether inexcusable
in seeking to rid myself of you. In conclusion,
I will say that about the time that I located with
some accuracy the particular spot where you were
living, I also discovered that for which I had been
seeking for many years&mdash;the underground cell
in which was Arnold de Villeneuve's laboratory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>This house is built upon the ground whereon his
stood. It is a wretched tumble-down affair, mean
and squalid, yet I have fitted it up for my home;
for, as you have discovered, it connects almost
directly with that underground vault where the
student and the master discovered their great
secret.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, for certain reasons that I need
not mention, I could not pass that circle and the
sign upon the wall around the door-way. So,
not being able to pass it myself, it was a great
temptation for me to send you to get those bottles
for me, and then, in your destruction, to
seal my own security. It was a great temptation,
I say, and I yielded to it. What I did was
unpleasant to you, perhaps, but that now is all
passed and gone. Let it be forgotten, and hereafter
we shall, I know, be great friends. That
attempt has taught me a lesson. I tried, in spite
of fate, to destroy you, and failed; now I will
try kindness, and see if that will eliminate you
from my life. I have it in my power to make
you the richest man in the world&mdash;next to myself;
and what is more, I will do so, and then
we shall separate forever. As for me, I shall
live in Paris, for there is no other place in the
world for a man of parts like myself. You, upon
your part, may live wherever you choose&mdash;except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>in Paris. You shall quit Paris <i>forever</i>. Do you
understand?&mdash;<i>forever</i>! Should you be so unfortunate
as to ever return here, should you be
so unhappy as ever to emerge from your obscurity
and cross my path, I will annihilate you.
But before I annihilate you I will make you suffer
the torments of hell, and wish that you had
not been born. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Oliver nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, my child, we comprehend
one another. Now I will show you Nicholas
Jovus's mirror, which I told you was in my
possession. It is a unique curiosity in its
way."</p>

<p>He rose, and crossing the room to what appeared
to be the door of a closet or cabinet,
opened it, and showed within a hollow space,
partly hidden by a curtain of some heavy black
material. Oliver had followed him, and as the
master drew back the curtain, he saw within an
oval mirror, set in a heavy frame of copper.</p>

<p>"Now, Oliver," said the master, "what is it
that you would wish to see?"</p>

<p>The thought of the perils from which he had
escaped and the perils which still lay before him
was uppermost in Oliver's mind. "I should like,"
said he, "to see that which will bring me the most
danger in my life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The master laughed. "It is a wise wish, my
child," said he; "look and see."</p>

<p>He stood aside, and Oliver came forward and
gazed into the glass. At first he saw nothing
but his own face reflected clear and sharp as in
an ordinary mirror; then suddenly, as he gazed,
the bright surface of the glass clouded over as
though with a breath blown upon it, and his own
face faded away from his view. The next moment
it cleared again, and he saw before him the
face and form of a young lady, the most beautiful
he had ever seen. He had only just time to observe
that she sat in the window recess of what
appeared to be a large and richly appointed room,
and that she was reading a letter. Then all was
gone&mdash;the master had dropped the curtain across
the glass.</p>

<p>Oliver put his fingers to his forehead and looked
about him, dazed and bewildered, for he felt
as though he were going crazy in the presence of
all the grotesque wonders through which he was
passing.</p>

<p>The master also seemed disturbed. He frowned;
he bit his lips; he looked at Oliver from under
his brows. "Who is the young lady?" said
he at last.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Oliver, faintly. "I
never saw her before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is a new complication," said the master.
"One woman is more dangerous than a score of
men." He brooded for a moment or two, and
then his face cleared again. "No matter," said
he; "we will not go to meet our difficulties, but
will wait till they come to us. All the same,
Oliver, take warning by one who knows that
whereof he speaks. Avoid the women as you
would a pitfall: they have been the ruin of many
a better man. Remember that which I have told
you of Raymond Lulli. He might perhaps have
been living to-day, the richest and happiest man
in the world, had he not been so stupid as to
love Agnes de Villeneuve."</p>

<p>Oliver made no reply, but even while the other
was uttering his warning he had determined in
his own mind to seize the very first opportunity
of looking again, and at his leisure, into the mirror,
and to see again that danger which appeared
in so alluring a form.</p>

<p>A calash has lately arrived, and the horses
are now being baited at the inn stables. The
day is excessively warm and sultry, so that the
young gentleman who came in the calash is having
his bread, and a bottle of the wine for which
the inn is famous, served to him under the great
chestnut-tree before the door. It is Oliver Munier,
but so different from the Oliver that left
Paris a year before that even his mother would
hardly have known him. He is no longer that
peasant lad in blouse who crouched, shrunk together,
in the corner of the great coach of the
rich American uncle, being carried with thunderous
rumble to some hideous and unknown fate
which he did not dare to tell even to his own
soul. He wore a silk coat, a satin waistcoat,
satin breeches, silk stockings, a laced hat; he
wore fine cambric cuffs at his wrists, and a lace
cravat with a diamond solitaire at his throat,
and his manners befitted his dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>He carried with him a small and curiously
wrought iron box, of which he seemed excessively
careful, keeping it close beside him, and every
now and then touching it with his hand, as
though to make sure that it had not been spirited
away.</p>

<p>The innkeeper, a merry little pot-bellied rogue,
as round as a dumpling and as red as an apple,
served him in person, talking garrulously the
while. Monsieur was on his way to Flourens?
Ah! there was great excitement there to-day.
What! Monsieur did not know? He must then
be a stranger not to know that Monseigneur the
Marquis had left Paris, and was coming back to
the château to live.</p>

<p>Oliver was interested. He had seen monseigneur
in Flourens once some two or three
years before, when he had paid a flying visit to
the château to put on another turn of the screw,
and to squeeze all the money he could from the
starving peasants of the estate, to pay some of
his more hungry and clamorous creditors. All
Flourens had known that the marquis was over
head and ears in debt, and now the little gossiping
landlord added the supplement. It was, he
told Oliver, through no choice that Monseigneur
the Marquis was to come back to the country
again, but because he had no more wherewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to support his Paris life. He loathed Flourens,
and he loved Paris; he hated the dull life of the
country, and he adored the gayety of the city,
its powder, its patches, its masques, its court, its
vanity, its show, and, most of all, its intrigues
and its cards. But all these cost money, for
Monseigneur the Marquis had lived like a prince
of the blood, and it had cost a deal. Ah, yes!
such little matters as intrigues and the cards
cost treasures of money in Paris, he had heard
say. So now the marquis and the family were
coming back again to Flourens.</p>

<p>By the time that the landlord had half done
his gossip, Oliver had finished his bread and
wine; then, the horses being refreshed, he bade
the servant whom he had brought down from
Paris with him to order out the calash. The
landlord would have assisted Oliver in carrying
his iron box, but Oliver would not permit it.
He commanded him somewhat sharply to let it
alone, and he himself stowed it safely within the
calash.</p>

<p>His man-servant was holding the door open
for him to enter, and Oliver already had his foot
placed upon the step ready to ascend, when the
clatter of hoofs and the rumble of a coach caught
his attention, and he waited to see it pass.</p>

<p>It was a huge, lumbering affair, as big as a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
house, and was dragged thunderously along by six
horses. A number of outriders surrounded it
as it came sweeping along amid a cloud of dust,
in the midst of which the whips of the postilions
cracked and snapped like pistol-shots.</p>

<p>So Oliver waited, with some curiosity, until the
whole affair had thundered by along the road,
with its crashing, creaking, rattling clatter, preceded
by the running footmen with their long
canes, and the outriders in their uniform of
white and blue. It was all gone in a moment&mdash;a
moment that left Oliver standing dumb and
rooted. In that instant of passing he had seen
three faces through the open windows of the
coach: the first, that of a stout, red-faced man,
thick-lipped, sensual; second, that of a lady, pale
and large-eyed, once beautiful perhaps, now faded
and withered. But the third! The third face was
looking directly at him, and it was the glimpse
of it that left him rooted, bereft of motion. It
was the same face that he had seen that first
day in the magic mirror in the master's house;
the face that he had seen in that mirror, and
unknown to the master, not once, not twice, but
scores of times&mdash;hundreds of times.</p>

<p>The landlord's voice brought him to himself
with a shock. "Monsieur has dropped his handkerchief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver took the handkerchief mechanically
from his hand, and as he entered the coach like
one in a dream, he heard the landlord say, as
his servant closed the door with a clash.</p>

<p>"That was Monseigneur the Marquis on his
way to the Château Flourens."</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Second.</span>&mdash;<i>The Widow Munier's house in Flourens.
Not the poor rude hut that Oliver had left her in when he
first went to Paris, but the house of the late Doctor Fouchette&mdash;the
best house in the town. The Widow Munier is
discovered sitting at the window, with her face close to the
glass, looking down the street expectantly.</i></h3>


<p>Oliver had been gone a year, and that year
had wrought great changes with her. All the
town knew that a great fortune had come to her,
and she was no longer the poor widow Munier,
the relict of Jean Munier the tailor; she was
Madame Munier.</p>

<p>After Oliver had been gone to Paris a week,
there came a letter for her from him, and in the
letter was money. Every week after came such
another packet with more and more money&mdash;enough
to lift her from poverty to opulence.
She was no longer obliged to eat cabbage soup,
or live in the poor little hut on the road. Just
about that time Doctor Fouchette died, and, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Oliver's bidding, she took the house for herself.
It was very pleasant to her, but there was one
thing that she could not understand. Her rich
American brother-in-law had distinctly told her
that he and Oliver were to go to Paris to choose
a house, and that she was then to be sent for to
live with them. She had never been sent for,
and that was what she did not understand. Yet
the weekly letters from Paris compensated for
much. In those letters Oliver often told her
that he and his uncle were in business together,
and were growing rich at such a rate as no one
had ever grown rich before. They were in the
diamond business, he said, and in a little while he
hoped to come home with more money than an
East Indian prince. Then, at last, a little while
after the twelvemonth had gone by, came a letter
saying that he would be home upon the next
Wednesday, in the afternoon. So now Madame
Munier was sitting at the parlor waiting for that
coming.</p>

<p>A calash came rattling along the stony street,
and as it passed, the good people came to the
doors and windows and looked after it. It did
not stop at the inn, but continued straight along
until it came to the door of Madame Munier's
house. Then it drew up to the foot-way, and
a servant in livery sprang to the ground and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
opened the door. A young gentleman stepped
out, carrying an oblong iron box by a handle in
the lid.</p>

<p>In thirty minutes all Flourens knew that Oliver
Munier had returned home; in sixty minutes
they knew he was as rich as Cr&oelig;sus.</p>

<p>As Oliver released himself from his mother's
embrace, he looked around him. It was all very
different from the little hut on the road that he
had left twelve months ago, but he seemed dissatisfied.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>"It will never do," said he.</p>

<p>"What will never do?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"This house, this furniture&mdash;all," said Oliver,
with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>His mother stared. "It is a fine house," said
she, "and the furniture is handsome. What,
then, would you have?"</p>

<p>"The house is small; it is narrow; it is mean,"
said Oliver.</p>

<p>His mother stared wider than ever. "It is
the best house in Flourens," said she.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Oliver; "but it does not
please me. It will serve for us so long as we
remain here, but I hope soon to remove to a
better place&mdash;one more suitable for people of
our condition."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Munier's eyes grew as round as teacups.
She began to notice that Oliver's manners
and speech were very different from what they
had been before he left Flourens a year ago.
She herself had never used the barbarous Flourennaise
patois.</p>

<p>"Remove to a better place?" she repeated,
mechanically. "To one more suitable for people
of our condition?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver. "I have in my mind a
château in Normandy of which I have heard. I
think of buying it."</p>

<p>Madame Munier's wonder had reached as high
as it could soar. She began to wonder whether
Oliver had not gone mad.</p>

<p>He gave her scarcely any time to recover
before he administered another and a greater
shock.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, suddenly, "the family returns
to the château to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said his mother; "they passed through
the town about a half an hour before you came."</p>

<p>"I know," said Oliver; "I saw them upon the
road. There were two ladies with monseigneur.
Do you know who they were?"</p>

<p>"One of them was thin and wrinkled, with
black eyes and heavy eyebrows?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"The other, a young girl, rather pretty?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is beautiful!" said Oliver.</p>

<p>"No doubt they were Madame the Marquise,
and Mademoiselle Céleste, the daughter," said
Madame Munier.</p>

<p>There was a little time of silence, and then
Oliver gave his mother that second shock, a
shock such as the poor woman never had in her
life before.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "I love Mademoiselle Céleste."</p>

<p>Madame Munier opened her eyes and mouth
as wide as she was able. "You what?" she
cried.</p>

<p>"I love Mademoiselle Céleste," said Oliver:
it was delicious to repeat those words.</p>

<p>Madame Munier looked slowly all about her,
as though she had dropped from the moon, and
knew not as yet where she was. "He loves
Mademoiselle Céleste!" she repeated to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver; "I love her."</p>

<p>"He loves her!" said Madame Munier, mechanically.
"He is mad!"</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">"'MAD!' SAID OLIVER, 'WHY AM I MAD?'"</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>"Mad!" said Oliver. "Why am I mad? Were
I a beggar and she a princess I might still love
her. Were I now as I was twelve months ago,
poor, ignorant, dull, a witless, idle sot, satisfied
to sit the day through on the bench in front of
the inn yonder, I might still love her! Were we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>living in poverty as we were then&mdash;you and I&mdash;dwelling
in that little stone hut, feeding upon
stewed cabbage and onions, I might still love
Céleste de Flourens! Love," cried Oliver&mdash;"love
is universal; it is limitless; it is the right of
every man, and no one can take it from him!"</p>

<p>Madame Munier listened; she thought that
she had never heard any one talk so beautifully
as Oliver. It put the matter in a new light.</p>

<p>"But I am no longer as I was then," continued
Oliver. "I have seen much; I have passed
through much; I have lived in Paris. But all
would be of no importance were it not for another
thing. Listen, mother! We are rich, you and I.
We are the richest people in France&mdash;excepting
one other; yes, the richest people in France!
You think me crazy to love Céleste de Flourens!
I tell you, I swear to you, I could to-morrow
buy Flourens from one end to the other&mdash;the
town, the château, and all. You do not believe
me? Very well, you shall see! But as for this
love of mine, it is not so hopeless nor so mad
as you think. To-morrow you shall go in my
coach, with my servant Henri, down to the château
yonder."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," interrupted
Madame Munier, sharply.</p>

<p>Oliver only smiled; he did not answer. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
habit he had caught from his master during the
last year was to contradict nobody. "To-morrow
you shall go down to the château in my
coach, with my servant Henri, and then you
shall see how complaisant the marquis will be."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," said Madame
Munier again. "I will not go down to the château."</p>

<p>Still Oliver did not seem to hear her. Going
to the table, he chose a key, and unlocking the
iron box, brought forth from it a curious old
silver snuffbox, handsomely chased and enamelled
with figures and flowers. "Do you see
this box?" said he, holding it up between his
thumb and finger.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Madame Munier, "I see it; but I
will not go to the château."</p>

<p>"It is only a snuffbox," said Oliver. "It is
a small thing; but what then? Within it is a
charm&mdash;a key with which I hope to unlock the
portals of a new world to us. It shall give us
the entrée to the château."</p>

<p>"I shall not go to the château," said Madame
Munier.</p>

<p>"Also," said Oliver, "I will give you a letter,
which you will present, together with this snuffbox,
to the marquis; and I shall sign the letter
Oliver de Monnière."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that is not your name," said Madame
Munier.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Oliver; "but it shall hereafter
be our name&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;De Monnière.
Remember it, mother&mdash;De Monnière."</p>

<p>"But what, then, is in the snuffbox?" said
Oliver's mother.</p>

<p>"I will show you," said Oliver, and he opened
the lid.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said his mother; "and is that all?
Do you think that Monseigneur the Marquis
will care for that thing?"</p>

<p>Oliver smiled. "Yes," said he, "he will care
for this thing."</p>

<p>Oliver's mother had nearly forgotten herself.
"I will not go to the château," said she.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Third.</span>&mdash;<i>The marquis's apartments at the château.</i></h3>


<p>It is the next day after the marquis has returned
to the Château de Flourens. It is three
o'clock in the afternoon, and the marquis is discovered
still in bed. His valet, August, an incomparable
fellow, has been in and out a dozen
times; has smoothed the marquis's clothes; has
rearranged a freshly-powdered wig that hung
as white as snow upon the block; has moved a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
chair here and a table there. But the Marquis
de Flourens has paid no attention to him. He is
reading the latest effusion of the immortal Jean
Jacques; for one must keep up with the world,
even if one is compelled to live in Flourens;
moreover, as he often observes, a book suffices
somewhat to relieve the ennui.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Flourens looks very droll.
He is clad in a loose dressing-robe of figured
cloth, and lies in bed reading his book, with a
chocolate-pot and a delicate cup, with the brown
dregs at the bottom, upon a light table standing
at the bedside. His knees are drawn up
into a little white mountain, the lace pillows are
tucked in billowy masses behind him, and his
nightcap is pushed a little to one side, giving a
glimpse of his shining, newly-shaven head; his
round face, in contrast with the white pillows
behind, as red as a newly-risen sun.</p>

<p>The valet again enters the room, but this time
with an object. He bears upon a silver tray a
three-cornered billet and a snuffbox. The marquis
lingeringly finishes the sentence he is reading,
and then lays the book face down upon the
bed beside him. "What is it you would have,
August?" said he.</p>

<p>"A lady, monseigneur, has just now stopped
at the door in a coach."</p>


<p><a name="I114"></a></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<p class="center">"HE IS CLAD IN A LOOSE DRESSING-ROBE OF FIGURED CLOTH,
AND LIES IN BED READING HIS BOOK."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>The marquis sat up as though moved by a
spring. "A lady?" he cried. "Young, beautiful?"</p>

<p>"No," said August, seriously; "old, fat."</p>

<p>The marquis lay back upon the pillows again.
"What is it that you have brought, August?"
said he, languidly. August presented the waiter.
"Oh!" said the marquis. "A letter; and what
is that&mdash;a snuffbox?" He reached out and took
Oliver's three-cornered billet from the waiter.
"This is not a woman's handwriting," said he;
"it is the handwriting of a man."</p>

<p>August said nothing, and the marquis opened
the letter. It ran as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Having heard, monseigneur,
that you have been interested in collecting odd
and unique objects of curiosity and virtu, I have
taken the great liberty of sending by madame
my mother this insignificent trifle, which I hope,
monseigneur, you will condescend to accept.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Oliver de Monnière.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>"M&mdash;m&mdash;m! What is it the fool is writing
about? Curios? I making a collection of curios?
I never collected anything in my life but debts.
The man is crazy! Does he think that I am a
snuffy collector of stuffy curios? Let me see the
snuffbox, August."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>The incomparable valet presented the waiter.</p>

<p>The marquis took the snuffbox in his hand
and looked at it. "It is handsome," said he;
"it is curious. It is solid silver, and is worth&mdash;"
he weighed it in his hand&mdash;"a hundred livres,
perhaps." He pressed the spring and opened the
box as he spoke. It was full of cotton. Something
dropped from it upon the coverlet. The
marquis picked it up. It was a diamond of excessive
brilliancy, almost as large as a bean.</p>

<p>The incomparable August was busied in removing
the chocolate-pot and the empty cup, but
presently observing the silence, he looked around.
The marquis was holding something between his
thumb and forefinger, and his eyes were as big
as teacups. His face was a sight to see. August
was startled out of his composure. He hastily
set the waiter with the china upon the window-seat,
and hurried to the bedside.</p>

<p>"What is it, monseigneur?" said he.</p>

<p>His voice roused the marquis.</p>

<p>"Where is the lady who came in the carriage?"
he cried, excitedly. "Run, stop her!" He flung
the bedclothes off himself and jumped with one
bound out upon the floor.</p>

<p>Once again August was startled out of his
decorum. "Monseigneur!" Then, recovering
himself again: "The lady, monseigneur, is gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The gardener, working upon the terrace below,
heard the rattle of a window flung violently open,
and, upon looking up, was very much surprised
to behold Monseigneur the Marquis, still clad in
his colored dressing-gown, and with his nightcap
thrust tipsily over one side of his head. So the
marquis stood looking out of the window staring
into space, for he had no more idea who it was
that had stopped at the door and had left him
a diamond worth twenty-five thousand livres
than if he had never been born. "Ha!" thought
he; "the letter; it was signed Oliver de Monnière."
Thereupon he drew his head in and shut
the window again.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Fourth.</span>&mdash;<i>The parlor of the house in Flourens.</i></h3>


<p>Oliver's mother has returned some little time
from the château, and Oliver and she are talking
it over between them.</p>

<p>"The marquis will visit us," said Oliver, "within
an hour."</p>

<p>"He will do no such thing," said Oliver's
mother; "he will not come at all."</p>

<p>"He will," said Oliver, taking out his brand-new
watch from his breeches pocket and looking
at it&mdash;"he will be here within a half an hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver's mother sniffed incredulously. Oliver
arose from the sofa where he was sitting and
went to the window, and there stood drumming
upon the sill, looking out into the street. Suddenly
he drew back. The rumble of a coach was
heard; it stopped before the house. A servant
opened the coach door, and monseigneur himself
stepped out.</p>

<p>He had driven over from the château, and had
stopped at the inn. Pierre was standing at the
door-way when the marquis leaned out from the
window and beckoned&mdash;yes, actually beckoned
to him. Pierre was so surprised that he took off
not only his hat, but his wig also, and stood there
bowing in the sun, with his head glistening like
a billiard-ball.</p>

<p>"Do you know, innkeeper, of one Monsieur de
Monnière who lives in this neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Monnière?" repeated Pierre,
blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the marquis, impatiently. "De
Monnière&mdash;Monsieur de Monnière. Do you
know where Monsieur de Monnière lives?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Monnière," repeated Pierre, stupidly;
he did not recognize the name.</p>

<p>The landlady stood in the door of the inn behind:
woman are quicker of wit than men.
"Monseigneur means Monsieur Oliver," said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The marquis overheard. "Yes," exclaimed he.
"Monsieur Oliver&mdash;Monsieur Oliver de Monnière."</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Oliver!" cried Pierre. "Oh
yes, I know him as well as I know myself. He
and his respected mother are now living up there
on the hill. You can, monseigneur, see the house
with your own eyes. It is that one with the
white wall to the side, and with the apple and
pear trees showing over the top. The rich Dr.
Fouchette used to live there. It is, monseigneur,
the finest house in Flourens. Monsieur Oliver
indeed! That is good! I have known Monsieur
Oliver ever since&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the coach was gone; the marquis had
called out to the driver, had pulled up the window
with a click, and now the coach was gone.
Pierre stared after it for a while, and then he
put on first his wig and then his hat, and went
into the house again.</p>

<p>So Oliver drew back from the window and
turned around. "You see, mother," said he,
"monseigneur comes, as I asserted he would."</p>

<p>Oliver's mother was in a tremendous flutter.
"And to think," said she, "of his coming all the
way from the château just because of a little
piece of cut-glass!"</p>

<p>Oliver laughed. "That little piece of cut-glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
was worth having," said he. "You do not yet
know the value of little pieces of cut-glass like
that, my mother."</p>

<p>Madame Munier did not listen to what Oliver
was saying. "And to think," said she, "of Monseigneur
the Marquis visiting me, the Widow
Munier!"</p>

<p>"You forget, mother," said Oliver. "You are
no longer Widow Munier, you are Madame de
Monnière."</p>

<p>Henri opened the door. "The Marquis de
Flourens," he announced; and the marquis entered
the room with his feathered hat and his
clouded cane in his hand.</p>

<p>"This is Monsieur Oliver de Monnière?" said
he.</p>

<p>Oliver bowed.</p>

<p>"And this lady?"</p>

<p>"Permit me," said Oliver; "my mother."</p>

<p>Madame de Monnière courtesied so low that
she nearly sat down upon the floor. She was
profoundly agitated; she was frightened; she
would rather be somewhere else. She was
pleased. Yes, it was delicious having a marquis
visit one in one's own house.</p>

<p>"And you, madame," said the marquis, "if I
may be permitted to ask, did me the honor of
calling upon me this morning?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de Monnière nodded. She was embarrassed
at the thought of what she had done;
she could not speak. Oliver spoke for her.</p>

<p>"She obliged me," said he, "by executing a
little commission for me. Pardon me, monseigneur,
that, knowing your interest as a collector,
I took the liberty of sending a small specimen to
you. I have your forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Forgiveness!" exclaimed the marquis. "You
ask me to forgive you? My dear child, I cannot
accept such a gift. It is too great!"</p>

<p>"Do not speak so," said Oliver. "It is nothing&mdash;a
trifle."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" cried the marquis; "a trifle! It
is worth twenty-five thousand livres."</p>

<p>"What then?" said Oliver. "I have many
others. You embarrass me by making so much
of such a little thing. Let me beg that you will
not refuse to accept of this trifle&mdash;as a connoisseur&mdash;as
a collector of curios&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the marquis, "there you touch me&mdash;as
a connoisseur&mdash;as a collector. Well, then, I
accept it. But you&mdash;you say you have many
others like this?&mdash;you are also a connoisseur?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver. "I have been indulging
a very considerable taste in that direction for
the past year. I think I may say now that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
have as fine a collection of diamonds as any in
Europe."</p>

<p>"Would that I might be permitted to see
them!" said the marquis.</p>

<p>"You shall," said Oliver; "at least some of
them. I can show you but a few at present. If
you will pardon me for a moment, I will go and
bring them."</p>

<p>He was gone, and Madame de Monnière and
Monseigneur the Marquis were left alone together.
For all this while the poor woman had
been sitting dazed and bewildered. The words
that had fallen upon her ears had overwhelmed
her. That bit of glass&mdash;that little bit of cut-glass&mdash;was
worth twenty-five thousand livres!
Twenty-five thousand livres! Monseigneur the
Marquis himself had said so! Twenty-five thousand
livres! and Oliver had given it to the marquis
as a trifle! Twenty-five thousand livres! and
she with her own ears had heard Oliver say that
he had many more bits of glass like it! Yes, he
had gone this very moment to bring them there
and show them to the marquis. Twenty-five
thousand livres! Was she dreaming or was she
waking? Twenty-five thousand livres! She
was amazed; she was bewildered; she was stupefied.
In the midst of all, the marquis turned
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you, madame," said he, "why did you
not wait this morning, and let me at least thank
you for this magnificent gift?"</p>

<p>Madame de Monnière's head was spinning.
"Twenty-five thousand livres!" said she.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said the marquis. "You are
embarrassed at the considerableness of it. It
is, indeed, from one point of view, a treasure;
but we connoisseurs, madame, we collectors, we
frequently exchange these little precious curiosities.
It is our habit."</p>

<p>Madame de Monnière rose for a moment to
the surface of her bewilderment. "Yes," said
she; "that is true;" and thereupon sank again
into the gulf. "Twenty-five thousand livres!"
she murmured to herself.</p>

<p>Just then Oliver returned. In his hand he
carried a small box of curiously-wrought iron.
Unlocking it, he raised the lid, removed a layer
of cotton, and then, tilting it, emptied upon the
table a handful of diamonds, that fell flashing
and sparkling like broken fragments of sunlight.
One or two of the gems rolled across the table
and fell hopping to the floor, but Oliver did not
appear to notice them. There was a pause of
blank and utter silence. Madame de Monnière
herself could not have been more amazed at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>sight she beheld than was the Marquis de Flourens.
Oliver spread out the gems upon the table
with his hand, as though they were so many glass
beads.</p>

<p>It was the marquis who broke the silence.
"Mon Dieu!" he whispered at last, and fetched
a breath so deep that it seemed to come from
the pit of his stomach. Then he roused himself.
"You have dropped some upon the floor," said
he. "I saw them fall." And he would have
stooped to find them.</p>

<p>Oliver smiled. "It is of no importance," said
he. "Henri will find them by-and-by."</p>

<p>For a while the marquis examined the stones
in silence, picking out some of the larger gems,
and scrutinizing them closely and critically, one
after another. "It is a most magnificent collection,
my young friend," said he at last. "I never
saw a finer lot of diamonds in my life, excepting
the King's."</p>

<p>"Oh, these are but a few," said Oliver. "I
am sorry that I have not some of my larger and
finer stones to show you."</p>

<p>"Only a few?" repeated the marquis. "And
how much, then, do you suppose that this collection
of diamonds is worth?"</p>

<p>"That would be hard to tell," said Oliver, smiling.
"But perhaps not more than half a million
livres. None of the stones are very large or fine."</p>

</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not large? Not fine?" cried the marquis,
and he picked out a diamond from among the
rest. "What, then, do you call this?"</p>

<p>"It is off color," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"It is a treasure that a king might covet!"
cried the marquis, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Oliver laughed. "You admire it?" said he.
"Then do me the favor to accept it."</p>

<p>The marquis rose to his feet. "Oh," he cried,
"this is too much! I do not dare."</p>

<p>"You pain me by refusing," said Oliver. "As
a connoisseur, monseigneur, as a collector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the marquis, "there you touch me
again. As a collector&mdash;well, then, I accept it,"
and he slipped it into his waistcoat pocket.
"Embrace me, Oliver!"</p>

<p>Oliver's mother was long past wondering at
anything, or else she might have thought it a
little strange to see Oliver&mdash;Oliver, the son of
Jean Munier, the tailor&mdash;clasped in the arms of
Monseigneur the Marquis of Flourens.</p>

<p>The marquis released Oliver from his embrace
and sat down again. "But tell me," said he,
"you and madame, you then live here?"</p>

<p>He looked around, and Oliver's eyes followed
his. It certainly was a poor house for one who
could empty half a million livres' worth of diamonds
upon a table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the present," said Oliver, "yes. We
have been very poor, my mother and I." He
paused. The marquis's eyes were resting intently
upon him, and he felt that the other waited for
further explanation. He had already arranged
a story, but now that the time had come to tell
it, his courage almost failed. "My uncle," said
he at last, "came back from America about a
year ago, and found us very poor&mdash;my mother
and me. He was rich." Again he paused for a
moment, and then continued: "He came from
Brazil, where he was the owner of a diamond
mine."</p>

<p>"But this uncle of yours," said the marquis,
"where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Oliver. "He is in heaven."</p>

<p>Oliver's mother heard what he said through
all the buzzing of the thoughts in her head.
"So, then," thought she to herself, "my brother-in-law
is dead, is he?"</p>

<p>"And you?" said the marquis.</p>

<p>"I?" said Oliver. "I have inherited his fortune.
It is all in diamonds."</p>

<p>Madame Munier pricked up her ears. She
was growing interested. Her Oliver, then, had
inherited a fortune.</p>

<p>"And your uncle's name&mdash;what was it?" said
the marquis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"His name?" said Oliver. "His name was
Henri, the Chevalier de Monnière-Croix."</p>

<p>"The devil!" whispered Oliver's mother to
herself. "I did not know that we were so well
connected." She was past being surprised at
anything now.</p>

<p>"De Monnière-Croix?" repeated the marquis.
"De Monnière-Croix? The name is not familiar."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Oliver. "My uncle was
very young&mdash;a mere child&mdash;when he went to
America, and for the twelve months past since
his return to France he and I have been living
quietly together in Paris, where he was engaged
in settling his affairs."</p>

<p>The marquis was looking steadily at him. "Is
your family of long descent?" said he.</p>

<p>"Not very; as I said, my father was very
poor; you know, monseigneur, how sadly poor
people of good family may be in the country&mdash;"
He hesitated, and then stopped.</p>

<p>"But," said the marquis, presently, "you say
your uncle is dead. Had he, then, no other heirs
than you? Had he no children?"</p>

<p>"No," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"And you inherit all&mdash;<i>all</i> his wealth?"</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>"It is then considerable?"</p>

<p>"It is one of the greatest fortunes in France."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you prove that to me?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Embrace me, my dear child!"</p>

<p>As the marquis rode back again to the château
he sat in the corner of the coach, meditating
deeply over all that he had seen and heard.
"The Chevalier de Monnière-Croix," he muttered
to himself&mdash;"the Chevalier de Monnière-Croix."
Then he suddenly aroused himself from his meditations,
thrust his thumb and finger into his
waistcoat pocket, and drew out the diamond
that Oliver had given him. He held it in a dozen
different lights, examining it keenly and critically.
Finally he thrust it back again into the pocket
whence he had taken it. "At least," said he,
"his diamonds are real. Why, then, should he
not be of noble family if he chooses? A half
a million livres' worth of diamonds, and that, as
he tells me, only a small part of his wealth!
Very well, then, his uncle was a chevalier and
he is a prince&mdash;the Prince de Golconda, if he
chooses."</p>

<p>Oliver stood for a long while looking out of
the window after the marquis's coach had driven
away. He felt very uneasy; he wished that he
had not told those lies; they frightened him.
He felt as if he could see them already flying
home again to roost. But he need not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
afraid. And then, besides, if there was a cloud,
it had had a silver edge: the last words that the
marquis had uttered had been: "My dear Oliver,
let me hope that we may soon see you at the
château&mdash;you and your mother" (that was an
after-thought), "for my daughter Céleste will
find it very stupid with no young people about.
I shall not, however, be able to show you my
collection of diamonds, unfortunately; they are
at present&mdash;ahem!&mdash;in Paris."</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Fifth.</span>&mdash;<i>A garden at the Château de Flourens.</i></h3>


<p>A garden such as Watteau loved to paint&mdash;bosky
trees, little stretches of grassy lawn, white
statues of nymphs and fauns peering from among
the green leaves, a statue of a naiad pouring water
from a marble urn, green with moss, into a
marble basin, green with moss.</p>

<p>In front of all, the smooth river, dusked and
dappled now and then by little breezes that
slowly sway the tops of the tall poplar-trees.
The little birds sing, and patches of sunlight and
shadow flicker upon the grass.</p>

<p>Enter Oliver and Mademoiselle Céleste. She
carries a pink parasol that makes her face glow
like a rose leaf, and Oliver walks by her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>That morning Oliver had paid his first visit to
the château. His master had trained him well
in the ways of the world during the twelvemonth
he had lived with him in Paris; nevertheless, he
came to the château quivering with trepidation.
But now the trepidation had passed and gone,
and it was all like the bewildering glamour of
some strange dream&mdash;the presence of his love no
longer dumbly reflected from the smooth, passionless
mirror, but in warm living flesh and
blood, breathing and articulate. She spoke; she
smiled; it was divine. A little wind blew a
gauze of hair across her soft cheek now and
then as they walked together; her sleeve brushed
against Oliver's arm, and Oliver's heart quivered
and thrilled.</p>

<p>That night was to him but a succession of
dreams, coming one after another like a continuous
panorama, only each separate picture centred
in one figure, and Oliver himself walked along
beside her, and told her that he loved her. It
was a deliciously restless night.</p>

<p>After Oliver had gone home, the marquis lingered
for a moment or two in madame's apartment,
standing with his back to the fireplace
listening while she talked to him.</p>


<p><a name="I130"></a></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">"ENTER OLIVER AND MADEMOISELLE CÉLESTE."</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>"I do not like him," said she; "he is ostentatious.
Who ever heard of wearing diamond knee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>and shoe buckles in the country? The solitaire
pin in his cravat was enormous."</p>

<p>"It was a magnificent diamond," said the
marquis.</p>

<p>"He is an adventurer," replied the marquise.</p>

<p>The marquis felt in his waistcoat pocket, and
brought out the two diamonds that Oliver had
given him. He held them in the palm of his
hand under the nose of the marquise. "Bah!"
said he; "you talk like a fool, Matilde. Do adventurers,
then, give away seventy-five thousand
livres' worth of diamonds as though they were
chestnuts? Did you ever hear of an adventurer
who carried around a half a million livres' worth
of diamonds in a little box? No; he may not
be an aristocrat, but he is certainly an Aladdin."</p>

<p>So Oliver was made welcome at the château
whenever he chose to come. By the time that a
month had passed, he had grown into a certain
intimacy. They all liked him; even madame
had condoned his diamonds and liked him. Then
one morning the marquis received an astounding
letter from his protégé.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," it said, "I recognize in you a
true and kind friend, a man of the world upon
whom I can depend." (Oliver's master in Paris
had done wonders for him; he really wrote very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>well.) "I am, monseigneur, troubled and harassed.
I am young and without experience. I
now have with me here my whole fortune, which
consists entirely of diamonds&mdash;the gleaning of
years from my American uncle's mines in Brazil.
I do not think that I overestimate, monseigneur,
in saying that that fortune is worth&mdash;" (I will
not repeat what the figures were, they were so
tremendous, so unbelievable, that the marquis
laid the letter down, and gazed around him bewildered.
"If this is true," said he, drawing a
deep breath, "my young friend is the richest
man in France." Thereupon he picked up the
letter, and read the figures over again, and then
over again. "He must have made a mistake of
a cipher," said the marquis. But no; the amount
was not only given in numbers, but written out
in full&mdash;there could be no mistake. The marquis
resumed the reading of the epistle.) "I am,"
continued the letter, "tormented with fears at
having this vast amount in my house"&mdash;"I
should think so," muttered the marquis to himself&mdash;"which,
though at present a profound secret,
may at any time be discovered. What dangers
I would then be in, I leave you to judge for
yourself. I have, monseigneur, no friends, no relatives,
of sufficient age and experience to advise
me in my difficulties. Accordingly I turn to you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>who have shown me so much kindness, and beseech
you that you will so far continue it&mdash;I may
say increase it&mdash;as to take charge of this treasure,
and advise me as to how I may best dispose
of it."</p>

<p>Such was the matter of Oliver's letter. The
Marquis de Flourens sat for a long while meditating
very deeply and seriously upon what he
had read. That same morning Oliver received
a note from him, "Bring your little fortune, my
child," it said. "What a father may do for a
son, I will do for you."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Sixth.</span>&mdash;<i>The marquis's cabinet. The marquis discovered
seated at a table, drumming upon it with his fingers,
and awaiting the coming of Oliver, who has just been announced.
Enter Oliver, carrying a stout iron-bound box,
which he deposits upon the table.</i></h3>


<p>"Your treasure is in that box?" says the marquis.</p>

<p>Oliver nodded. He was very pale.</p>

<p>The marquis arose, and not only locked the
door, but even covered the key-hole from the
drilling of inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear child," said he, turning to
Oliver with a smile, "let us see what we have in
our box;" and he drew his chair again to the
table beside which Oliver was standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>They were both of them agitated&mdash;the marquis
from expectancy, and Oliver from the great
cast of the die of his life, which he had determined
that day to make. The hand with which
he unlocked the box was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>The contents of the box was covered with a
layer of cotton. Oliver removed it, and then by
two straps lifted out a shallow wooden tray covered
with purple velvet, and filled with a glittering
mass of diamonds of the purest water, nearly
all of them large and fine. The marquis's eyes
gleamed as brightly as the stones themselves.</p>

<p>Below the tray was another layer of cotton.
Oliver removed it and then another tray; then
another layer of cotton and another tray, until
there were eight of them spread upon the table&mdash;it
could hold no more.</p>

<p>"There are two more trays in the box," said
Oliver, "but it is not necessary that I should
show you them; these are sufficient."</p>

<p>The marquis did not reply; he was overwhelmed
by what he beheld; it seemed to him
that he saw the treasures of Golconda. Oliver
observed his silence, and, looking up, saw that his
face had grown white with the intensity of his
emotions. At last he drew a deep breath, and
raised his eyes to Oliver's; then feeling in his
pocket, he drew forth his handkerchief and wiped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
his face. His voice was husky when he spoke.
"But this vast, this unbelievable treasure," said
he, "what security shall I give you if you intrust
it to me to manage for you?"</p>

<p>The opportunity for Oliver's <i>coup</i> had arrived.
The marquis himself had given him the very
chance which he sought, but now that he was
face to face with it, he trembled, he hesitated, he
feared to put his happiness to the test of speech.
Yet he knew that now or never was the time to
cast the die of his hopes upon the table of fate.
He braced himself, gathered all the force of his
will, and as the blinding rush of resolution overwhelmed
him, he saw only the marquis's face and
the marquis's eyes looking into his.</p>

<p>"Your security," said he, hoarsely&mdash;and his
voice sounded in his ears as though it was not
his own&mdash;"your security&mdash;let it&mdash;let it be&mdash;your
daughter."</p>

<p>The words were spoken. There came a long
pause of deep, intense silence, through which
Oliver could hear the throbbing blood singing in
his ears. The marquis never moved a hair, but
sat looking into Oliver's eyes. Oliver felt a dry,
hard lump gather in his throat; he tried to swallow
it. The marquis pushed back his chair and
arose. Oliver's eyes dumbly followed his motion.
The marquis began walking up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the room, but he did not say "No." After a
while he stopped before one of the windows and
there stood a while, with his hands clasped behind
him, looking out upon the lawn and the
river beyond. Minute after minute passed in a
straining tensity of silence. Oliver began to feel
as though he could bear it no longer. Suddenly
the marquis spoke:</p>

<p>"My daughter?" said he, half aloud and half
to himself. The words meant nothing, but they
were not words of refusal. Oliver felt a great
wave of blinding hope sweep over him. Suddenly
the marquis turned and came back to the
table. He motioned Oliver to a chair. "Let us
talk this matter over," said he, seriously, and
they both sat down. Oliver's heart thumped
within him like a trip-hammer. "Do you
know," said the marquis, "what a thing it is
that you ask? Do you know that you ask
an alliance with one of the noblest houses of
France?" Oliver could not answer. "And
you," continued the marquis, "who are you? I
do not know you; nobody knows you. You may
be what you represent yourself to be; you may
be an adventurer."</p>

<p>Oliver's heart was sinking like a plummet of
lead. "My diamonds are real," he croaked.</p>

<p class="center">"'DO YOU KNOW,' SAID THE MARQUIS, 'WHAT A THING IT IS THAT YOU ASK?'"</p>

</div>



<p>The marquis smiled, and then a long space of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>silence fell. At last he spoke again, and his
words shot through Oliver's heart like a dart.
"What settlement, then, would you propose to
make upon your wife?" said he.</p>

<p>"Wife!" Oliver's heart thrilled with the sudden
keenness of that pang of sharp delight. His
brain whirled in an eddy of dizzy light. At
last, with a supreme effort, he found his tongue.
"Anything," he cried&mdash;"anything that you
choose!"</p>

<p>The marquis smiled again. "We are ardent,"
said he. "I see that if this matter is to be carried
forward, I must act not only as a father,
but as a friend. I confess to you, Oliver, that I
am deeply in debt, that Flourens is mortgaged
to the last inch. Would you be willing to release
Flourens, and then settle the estate upon
your wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver, eagerly.</p>

<p>The marquis's smile grew wider than ever.
"That is good," said he. "But you must know
that you are one of the richest men in France,
Oliver. You should do even more than that for
your wife."</p>

<p>"I will settle upon her everything that I have
in the world," said Oliver.</p>

<p>The marquis laughed. "Ah!" said he, "we
are certainly too ardent&mdash;far too ardent. Half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of your fortune would be sufficient; or three-quarters
of it, at the most."</p>

<p>"She shall have either, as you may choose,"
said Oliver.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the marquis, "that it will be
best that I should manage her fortune for her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver. "And you shall manage
mine also, if you choose."</p>

<p>The marquis saw that there was no limit to
Oliver's complacency. "And you will subscribe
to that?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oliver. "I am willing to subscribe
to anything."</p>

<p>The marquis rose from the chair, and opened
his arms. "Embrace me, my son," said he.</p>

<p>Oliver could have cried with happiness. "And
may I," said he, tremulously, when the marquis
had released him from his arms&mdash;"may I then&mdash;"
He hesitated; he could not believe that he had
reached such a dizzy pinnacle of happiness.</p>

<p>The marquis laughed. "You will find mademoiselle
in the garden," said he.</p>

<p>Enter Oliver, running down the steps of a terrace,
dizzy with joy, like one in the bewildering
glamour of a golden dream. He seemed to tread
upon air! The blue sky, green foliage, the flowers,
the statues, the rivers, swam together in a
confusion of bewildered delight. At the sound
of his footsteps she raises her eyes, and lays aside
her book, and greets him with the smile of an
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said she; "it is you, then? I have been
waiting for you."</p>

<p>Oliver's heart was fluttering within him. At
first he could not speak, and she must have read
his joy and his secret in his face, for the rosy hue
upon her cheeks deepened.</p>

<p>He sank upon his knees beside her. "I love
you," he whispered, tremulously.</p>

<p>Her face was turned away from him, but she
did not withdraw the hand which he held. There
was a long time of silence. Oliver raised her
hand to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"But my father," she murmured at last.</p>

<p>"He bade me seek you here," cried Oliver,
eagerly. Then again: "Oh, Céleste, I love you!
I love you!"</p>

<p>She turned her face towards him; her eyes met
his then. Could he believe it? Was it real?
His lips met others, soft, warm, fragrant. The
flowers, the parterres, the trees, the blue sky, the
white marble statues&mdash;all dissolved into a golden
ether. Flourens? It was heaven!</p>

<p>Madame the Marquise made no objection to it
all. She had become accustomed to Oliver and
his diamonds. He was a pleasant, cheerful,
handsome fellow. It made her heart feel lighter
to have him about. As was said, she had forgiven
the ill taste of the display of diamonds,
and now expressed her approval of the arrangement.
Oliver's heaven was without a cloud.</p>

<p>A month had passed&mdash;a month of delight, of
joy, of love; and then one morning the Marquis
de Flourens let fall a torpedo in the midst of
Oliver's little paradise. That morning, when
Oliver went to the château, the marquis sent for
him. Oliver found him seated at the table, playing
idly with a gold pencil-case. He did not ask
Oliver to be seated, but went directly to the point.</p>

<p>"A week from next Monday," said he, "we
shall go to Paris. You also, my dear Oliver."</p>

<p>Oliver stood like one stunned. He made no
answer, but his mind, in a single sweep, cleared
the whole horizon. To Paris! He remembered
the master's commands&mdash;those commands so terribly
absolute; he remembered his threats of
punishment if he (Oliver) should disobey that
mandate. What was that threat? Oliver remembered
it well. It was that that terrible
mysterious being, who had so nearly doomed
him to a dreadful, unspeakable death, would crush
him, would annihilate him, would make him wish
a thousand times, in his torments, that he had
never been born. Those were almost the very
words, and Oliver had not forgotten them. He
had learned much of his master in the year that
he had lived with him, and he knew that that
threat was not idle. He knew that the master
would do as he said to the last jot and tittle.
That cool, smiling, sinister devil! He could destroy
all of this happiness as easily as one can
destroy a beautiful soap-bubble that a child has
created from nothing.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to go to Paris," said Oliver,
huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>The marquis's face darkened. "Not wish to
go to Paris?" he repeated. "But you must go,
Oliver."</p>

<p>"No," said Oliver; "I do not wish to go. I
shall not go. I would rather stay here at Flourens.
I do not like Paris."</p>

<p>The marquis came over and took Oliver by
the button of his coat. His face was not pleasant
to see. "You do not like Paris!" said he.
"Very well; then you shall stay here, my dear
Oliver&mdash;you and your fortune. But in that case,
my child, you need never come here to the
château again. You comprehend me?"</p>

<p>Oliver looked out of the window. Céleste was
waiting for him upon the terrace. Never had
she looked so exquisitely beautiful. He groaned.</p>

<p>"Then I will go," said he.</p>

<p>The marquis opened his arms. "Embrace me,
Oliver," he cried.</p>

<p>Oliver yielded himself to the caress, but he
wished the marquis to the devil.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">ACT III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paris.</span></h2>




<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene First.</span>&mdash;<i>Madame de Pompadour's salon.</i></h3>


<p>Some dozen courtiers, male and female, are
gathered in a group at a little distance, but not
too far away, from a sofa standing by an open
window, just where the breeze comes in pleasantly
from without. A lady dressed in negligee
<i>robe de chambre</i> of blue satin lies upon the sofa,
propped up with pillows. She is slowly fanning
herself with a very charmingly painted fan, listening
the while impassively to the subdued talk,
and the occasional ripple of laughter that follows
some more than usually apt observation or repartee.
She does not talk or smile herself, but only
continues fanning herself with slow impassiveness.
She is still beautiful, but she is somewhat haggard
and worn, and even the powder and rouge,
and an occasional patch here and there, cannot
altogether hide the leaden pallor of ill health. It
is Madame de Pompadour, and it is one of the
days in which she feels more than usually unwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The conversation of those around chiefly concerns
two lovers, whom all Paris is just now petting
and caressing, the young and charming
Monsieur de Monnière-Croix and his fiancée Mademoiselle
de Flourens. The match is altogether a
singular and remarkable one. Those who have
seen the young man report him very handsome,
but it is whispered that he is of obscure origin.
Were it not for his stupendous wealth, the story
of which is very well authenticated, it would have
been a dreadful misalliance. As it is, that wealth
is so great as to level all distinctions, and the
world has not only forgiven the match, but has
been vastly interested in the love affair. The
talk of it has reached even Madame de Pompadour's
ears, and she has been pleased to express a
desire to have them presented to her. The day
and the time for that presentation has arrived,
and that perhaps is why the conversation just
now concerns the lovers.</p>

<p>Madame de Berry protests that they are the
handsomest couple that she has ever seen; their
love so innocent, so deliciously childlike. They
are a new Corydon and Phyllis&mdash;Cupidon and
Psyche. In them Arcadia is come again. It is
the prettiest thing in the world to see their uneasiness
when separated, their fond glances when
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur de Gontat had heard the Duchesse
de Choiseul speak of them the other day. She
declares them her latest passion, and says that
they are like that which the poets describe, and
which nobody ever saw before. She loves to
have them near her&mdash;the dear Duchesse&mdash;and
says that they make her feel that life is not altogether
like the new screen that Monsieur Watteau
has just finished for her, not altogether flat,
not altogether surface, not all pretended simplicity
in powder and patches, and with painted
fan to hide a painted blush; she says they make
her have a better opinion of herself. So the
buzz of talk goes on, and Madame de Pompadour
fans herself and listens impassively.</p>

<p>Then the talk suddenly turns to the Count de
St. Germaine, who has grown such a favorite, not
only with Madame de Pompadour, but of late
with his Majesty himself.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Gontat tells of the last wonder
relating to him. Yesterday his Majesty sent for
him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Count," said he, "they say that you
can remove flaws from a diamond. Is it so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire," answered the count.</p>

<p>"Then here is a diamond that would be worth
fifty thousand livres except for this flaw; it is not
worth five thousand now. Can you remedy it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can try, sire," answers the count, and he
slips it into his waistcoat.</p>

<p>Would you believe it? He brings it in this
morning sound and whole and without flaw.</p>

<p>"I myself," says Monsieur de Gontat, "was
present when the jeweller appraised it. His
Majesty said that he would keep it as one of the
greatest curiosities of his cabinet."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Gontat had hardly ended his story
when Oliver and Céleste were announced.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour ceased her fanning
and turned her head languidly as they were
ushered across the room and presented.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Flourens, who had come with
them, was also presented. He paid his respects,
and then immediately withdrew to one side, and
was absorbed in the little group of those in waiting.</p>

<p>Madame reached out her hand to Céleste. "Come
hither, my child, and let me look at you," said she.</p>

<p>Céleste came timidly forward, and Madame de
Pompadour took her by the hand. She drew
her down until the girl kneeled upon the floor
beside the sofa. The poor sick woman looked
long and earnestly into her young face.</p>

<p>"You are beautiful, you are young, you are
happy," she murmured. "You are happy, are
you not?"</p>

</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," answered Céleste, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"And you love Monsieur de Monnière-Croix?"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Céleste again, and her voice
thrilled.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour fetched a little half-sigh,
which faded to a smile before it had left
her lips. "Ah!" said she, "it is the young who
are happy." Then, after a moment's pause,
"Will you kiss me, child?"</p>

<p>Céleste bent forward, and her fresh young innocent
lips met those others&mdash;so soiled, so wan
and faded. It was all as effectively done as anything
upon the boards of the Comédie Française.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour turned with a smile,
and beckoned to Oliver.</p>

<p>"Come, Monsieur Count," said she, "your
place should be here beside your lady;" and she
motioned to him to kneel beside Céleste.</p>

<p>Oliver saw the ladies and gentlemen who stood
around smile. He was embarrassed; he blushed
like a school-boy; but there was nothing for him
to do but to kneel. Céleste saw his confusion,
and furtively reached out her little hand and
gave his an encouraging squeeze. Madame de
Pompadour saw it and smiled. Yes, it certainly
was Arcadian.</p>

<p>At that moment another arrival was announced,
"Monsieur the Count de St. Germaine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Now and then the name of the Count de St.
Germaine, and the story of his strange doings,
reached even to the paradise of the lovers. Occasionally
Oliver heard a breath of these things,
and when he heard it he trembled&mdash;the breath
was sinister and smelt from the pit. But he was
not troubled for long at a time; his cockle
floated gayly along the stream of fateful happiness;
he was too absorbed in his love-dreams to
burden his thoughts with the fear of being overwhelmed
in the dark waters upon which that
cockle swam. Nevertheless, the name, falling so
unexpectedly upon Oliver's ears, came with a
certain shock of dread. He bent his head as he
kneeled, and for a time did not dare to look
around. The new-comer came forward with the
well-assured air of a favorite. Oliver could feel
him coming nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"Rise, my children," said Madame de Pompadour.
And as they obeyed, she presented Oliver
to the other. "Monsieur de St. Germaine," said
she, "let me present to you Monsieur de Monnière-Croix."</p>

<p>Oliver slowly raised his eyes, and then his
heart crumbled away within him. <i>It was the
master!</i></p>

<p class="center">"MONSIEUR THE COUNT DE ST. GERMAINE!"</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>It seemed to Oliver as though the room darkened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>around him, and he saw but one thing&mdash;that
cold, handsome face. His ears rang as
though with a chime of bells. The floor seemed
to rock beneath his feet, for he knew what to
expect when those thin lips parted&mdash;he would be
denounced, exposed, here before Madame de Pompadour
and her court. His heart shrunk together,
but he steeled himself to face the coming blow.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. The thin lips parted,
the face lit up with a smile. "Ah," cried the
well-known voice, "it is Oliver; it is the little
Oliver! You do not remember me. No? Oh,
well, it is not likely you would; and yet I was
the dearest friend that your poor uncle, who is
now in Paradise, had in the world." He turned
to the others who stood there, still holding Oliver
by the hand, which he had taken when he
first began speaking. "The world," said he,
"does not yet know half the romance connected
with this young man. His uncle Henri, Chevalier
de Monnière-Croix, was one of the richest
men in France. Poor soul! he is dead now, but
when he lived he was the owner of one of the
largest diamond mines in Brazil. Diamonds!
The world has never seen the like of the Chevalier
de Monnière-Croix's diamonds! And now
this young man has been left heir to them all.
Henri de Monnière-Croix and I were in Brazil
together, and it was with him that I gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
what little knowledge I possess concerning precious
stones; I may say, indeed, that he was my
teacher in that knowledge. I was intimately
acquainted with his affairs, and know that Oliver,
as is reputed of him, is one of the richest
men in Europe."</p>

<p>All who were present listened to the count's
speech with breathless interest and in dead
silence. But to Oliver the words he heard
spoken lifted him at a bound from the gulf of
despair into which he was falling. The master
did not mean to ruin him just then. The rebound
from the tensity of the strain was too
great for him to bear. The ground beneath his
feet heaved and rocked, the room spun around
and around. He heard some one, he knew not
whom, give a sharp exclamation; he felt a strong,
sinewy arm clasp him about the body; he knew
it was the master's arm, and then&mdash;nothing.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Second.</span>&mdash;<i>A room in the Hôtel de Flourens, whither
Oliver has been removed after having fainted in madame's salon.</i></h3>


<p>It is the next day, and Oliver is discovered lying
upon a sofa, limp, heart-sick, overshadowed by
the looming of coming misfortune. The ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
have sent many inquiries as to his health, and
two little notes from Céleste are lying upon the
table at his elbow. Enter suddenly Henri, who
is in attendance upon him.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see monsieur," said the valet,
and almost instantly another voice, speaking from
behind him, said:</p>

<p>"It is I, Oliver. I have taken the liberty of
an old friend of your dear uncle; I was anxious
concerning your health, and so followed immediately.
You need not wait, Henri"&mdash;to the
valet.</p>

<p>He entered as he spoke, and waiting for a moment
to make sure that Henri had gone, then
closed the door and turned to Oliver, who now sat
speechless, motionless, fascinated, with eyes fixed,
and a face as white as wax. He drew forward
a chair, and placing it close to Oliver, sat for a
long time looking fixedly and intently at him.
At last, without removing his eyes, he drew out
his snuffbox&mdash;the famous snuffbox that Madame
de Pompadour had given him with her own hands&mdash;and
took a pinch of snuff with a deal of gusto.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "have you nothing to say to
me?"</p>

<p>"I thought," said Oliver, dully, "that it was
you who had, perhaps, something to say to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The Count de St. Germaine laughed. "Something
to say to you?" said he. "Oh! You mean,
perhaps, about that looking-glass of mine, upon
which you drew that accursed sign with one of
those very diamonds that I had taught you to
make? Perhaps you thought that by doing so
you would prevent my following your motions
for the future. Well, as far as the mirror is
concerned, you were right; you have spoiled it
for me. You, who are generally so dull, sometimes
surprise one with sudden gleams of your
bucolic cunning. I confess that you did most
effectually what you intended; you ruined that
looking-glass forever. So far as I am concerned,
I can never see anything in it again.
Are you not deserving of punishment for
that?"</p>

<p>Oliver strove to speak, but his white lips uttered
no sound.</p>

<p>"Again," said the Count de St. Germaine, "I
commanded you when we parted that you should
never return to Paris; I forbade you imperatively,
absolutely, from coming. I unbosomed
myself to you and told you all; I confessed to
you that I feared your influence upon my destiny.
What has resulted? You, knowing that
you have taken away all my means of following
your movements, did return here against those
express commands that I had laid upon you,
braving all my threats of punishment. Should
you not be punished for that?"</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could not help it," said Oliver, hoarsely;
"the marquis compelled me to come."</p>

<p>Once more the other laughed. "I know nothing
of that," said he. "I only know that you
are here. Why you are here concerns yourself,
and not me. Now what do you think that I am
about to do to you, Oliver?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Oliver. And he hid his
face in his trembling hands.</p>

<p>The Count de St. Germaine, without removing
his eyes from his victim, took another deep, luxurious
pinch of snuff. Then he shut the lid with
a snap, and slipped the box again into his pocket,
but all that time his eyes never once moved from
the cowering Oliver. Suddenly he burst out
laughing, and clapped the lad upon the shoulder.
"I will tell you what I will do to you, Oliver,"
said he; "I will forgive you! Do you hear me?
<i>I will forgive you!</i>"</p>

<p>Oliver slowly removed his hands from his face,
and looked up with dumb bewilderment. "You
forgive me?" he repeated, stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgive you."</p>

<p>A long pause of silence followed, during which
Oliver looked intently and earnestly into that
smiling face, so close to his own. That smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
face&mdash;it was an impenetrable mask, it was the
face of a sphinx, and Oliver might almost as
well have tried to read the one as the other.
Yet there was a soul behind it, and that soul
could not entirely be hidden; one glimpse of it
flashed out through the eyes. Oliver saw it and
shuddered.</p>

<p>"You forgive me?" he repeated. "What do
you mean? I do not comprehend. What would
you have me do?"</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders and raised
his eyebrows. "What would I have you do?"
said he. "You surprise me! I talk to you, and
you do not seem to hear me. I say that I forgive
you, and you do not seem to understand.
What I mean is that you shall continue to live
here, as you have already done, in an atmosphere
of happiness and love. It is beautiful, as all Paris
says; it is delightful! After all, I cannot punish
you, for I have not the heart to interfere with
it. By-and-by you shall marry Mademoiselle
Céleste."</p>

<p>Oliver never removed his looks from the other's
face. "Marry Céleste?" he murmured, mechanically.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the other, "I never saw
you so dull. I said that you were to marry
Mademoiselle Céleste&mdash;to marry her. But, there!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
I see what it is. You are not yet recovered
from your illness in Madame de Pompadour's
salon. It was indeed insufferably hot. Poor
lady! she is like a green cockatoo, she cannot
abide a touch of cold. But I weary you; I will
take another opportunity of visiting you. But
remember, my dear Oliver, I forgive you. <i>Au
revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>He was gone; and Oliver sat as Monsieur de
St. Germaine had left him, clad in his dressing-gown,
and seated upon the edge of the sofa,
leaning with his elbows upon his knees, his hands
clasped before him, and his eyes fixed dully upon
the floor. Forgive him! His soul told him that
he need expect no forgiveness from that cold,
iron heart. What should he do? How should
he escape the fate which he felt was hanging
over him? The master had said that he was to
marry Céleste. Upon the eve of that marriage,
perhaps, he would come and proclaim him the
cheat, the charlatan that he was. He shuddered
as he pictured the shame of the humiliation of
such a disclosure. Suddenly a thought flashed
upon him, like light upon the darkness: why not
tell Céleste his story? Why not confess all to
her, and throw himself upon her mercy? His
shame would be less, and she would scorn him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>less, than if he waited for the Count de St. Germaine
to expose him. His heart stood still at
the thought of Céleste's grief and despair. And
Paris! How Paris would laugh at the denouement
of that romance which it now petted and
approved. In a sudden rush of determination,
and without giving himself time for second
thought, he drew paper and ink towards him,
and set himself to write a letter to Céleste. It
was a blundering, blotted letter. It took him a
long, long time to write it, but at last it was
done; in it he told her all; and then, still without
giving himself time to think, he rang the
bell, and Henri appeared. He hesitated, for one
last moment, with a shrinking heart.</p>

<p>"What will monsieur have?" said Henri.</p>

<p>"Take this letter," said Oliver, with one last,
desperate resolve,"to Mademoiselle Céleste, and&mdash;and
wait her answer."</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>Oliver watched the man as he crossed the
room, as he noiselessly closed the door; he was
gone.</p>

<p>How long the answer was in returning Oliver
never could tell. It might have been only a few
minutes that he walked up and down the room.
It seemed to him hours.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, a letter."</p>

<p>Oliver turned sharply. It was Henri, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
presented upon his tray a little note. It was, as
far as outward appearance was concerned, almost
exactly like those two others upon the table; but
what was within? Oliver hardly dared touch it.
He opened it slowly, hesitatingly; there were
only three words, "I love you"&mdash;that was all.
Yes, that was all. Oliver sat looking at it with
eyes that blinded more and more, until at last
one hot drop fell with a pat upon the open sheet.
Then even Henri's presence was not enough to
inspire self-control. He broke down, and began
crying, and probably, if Henri thought anything
at all, it was that there had been a quarrel.</p>

the hour, near midnight. Oliver is discovered walking rapidly
and agitatedly up and down the length of the great
room, still illuminated by a thousand and one candles.</i></h3>


<p>And now the last guest has been gone for some
time, the last huge unwieldy coach has rumbled
away, and the dull silence seems to hum and buzz
after the clatter of the afternoon and night. He
is married. Oliver is still bewildered. He is
like one in a dream; he only half knows what
he does and says; he only half senses what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>sees and hears; his heart thrills almost agonizingly
with joy and triumph. Céleste is his, his
very own, his wife; and what is more, it has
been arranged that he and she are to depart for
Flourens&mdash;dear, sweet, beautiful Flourens&mdash;the
very next morning.</p>

<p>Some days before, Oliver had proposed the
departure to the marquis, and the marquis
had made no objection. He had made but one
stipulation, that he himself should remain in
Paris.</p>

<p>"There are many matters of business to attend
to," he had said. "We have as yet been able to
dispose of only a minute portion of our diamonds.
The amount we have realized upon them has
been enormous, yet it is only a drop or two taken
from the bucket."</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Oliver was to see
the marquis upon some final business that very
night, and so it is that he is now discovered walking
so impatiently up and down the empty room
at that hour, his heart thrilling with joy and delight.
But through all Oliver's joy and delight
there ran every now and then a discordant pang
of uneasiness, for suddenly, in spite of himself,
his thoughts would flash back upon the memory
of the master, and under that vivid sinister flash
of recollection his soul shrank and trembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>within him. Twelve hours still stretched between
him and that time of departure. What
might not happen in twelve hours?</p>

<p>"Twelve hours," muttered Oliver to himself.
"I would give all my diamonds if they were
passed and gone." He thought of Céleste, and a
keen thrill pierced through his heart; he thought
of the master, and another keen thrill&mdash;this time
heart-sickening&mdash;shot through him as the other
had done. "No matter," he muttered to himself,
"the morning will soon come and we will
be miles away, with nothing to fear and with
nothing to think of but our love." He pressed
his face against the window and looked out into
the night, then he turned and pulled out his
watch impatiently and looked at it; it was ten
minutes of twelve. "I wish he would make
haste," he muttered.</p>

<p>As though in answer to his impatient murmur,
the door opened and a servant announced that
the marquis was ready to see him now in his
closet.</p>

<p>Oliver found him seated at his escritoire, with
books and papers spread out before him. He
took the chair that the marquis indicated, and
then the marquis began talking to him. Oliver
did not know what he was saying; whenever
the other would pause for a reply, he would say,
"Yes, yes, that is so," or, "I think not," as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
words seemed to demand; sometimes he understood
what was said, but more generally it might
as well have been spoken in Greek.</p>

<p>"Then," said the marquis, "if I understand
correctly, you are entirely satisfied with my
management of your affairs?"</p>

<p>Oliver was beginning to grow weary of this
business. "Yes," said he, restlessly, "yes, I am
entirely satisfied. Manage them as you choose;
I do not care; it is of no importance."</p>

<p>The marquis opened his arms. "Embrace me!"
he cried. "You are generosity itself; I admire
generosity! Your confidence in me touches me.
You must know, Oliver, that I manage most discreetly.
We have lived here, as you are aware,
without stint or economy&mdash;it would have been
wrong for me to limit that generosity of yours
which I so much admire&mdash;but yet I have not
been extravagant; for not only have we maintained
the establishment here in Paris, but we
have also paid off the debts upon it, as well as
upon Flourens. Yes, Flourens is freed; and I&mdash;I
am not to be outdone in generosity; those ancestral
estates of Flourens that have been in the
hands of our family for generations"&mdash;he waved
his hand&mdash;"I give them to you, Oliver, and to
Céleste for your own."</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>The marquis paused for a moment; his own
generosity moved him profoundly. "But I was
about to say," continued he, presently, "that the
reason more especially why I called you here
was to let you see how few of our diamonds
have been disposed of. I will show you."</p>

<p>"I do not care to see," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the marquis, "but you
must see them, my dear Oliver. It is business.
Look! yonder is the chest of diamonds. I have
had it brought here to-day not only to show you
how little of the contents we have as yet disposed
of, but also because I expect three merchants
from Amsterdam to visit me to-morrow
and inspect the gems. They write to me that
they have formed a company for the purchase
of a quantity of them."</p>

<p>While he was speaking he had taken a bunch
of keys from a secret compartment of the escritoire.
One of them was the key of the chest.
He thrust it into the lock, drew back the bolts,
and opened the lid. "You see," said he, "there
is not one-tenth of this first tray of diamonds
that we have as yet disposed of." Oliver glanced
indifferently at them. "The rest of the trays,"
continued the marquis, "have not yet been touched.
I will show them to you."</p>

<p>"I do not care to see them," said Oliver; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
will take your word for it. If there is nothing
further that you care to speak to me about, I
would like to be excused; there are many things
that I have to prepare for my journey."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the marquis, "I see these dull affairs
of business, they are of no interest to you.
Youth is so impetuous! It is better," said he,
as he locked the chest and replaced the keys in
the secret compartment of his escritoire&mdash;"it is
better to possess youth and love than all the
wealth and gems of the Indies. Go, my dear
Oliver, and trust in me. I will manage your affairs,
my child, as though they were my own."</p>

<p>Oliver did not wait for a second bidding; he
flew from the place and the tiresome talk of
diamonds and business. As he was about to
enter the room which he had left only a little
while before, he hesitated for a moment, he knew
not why. A sudden pang shot through him, and
he pressed his hand to his bosom. That instant
a clock rang out sharply in the silence. He
counted the twelve strokes, and then opened
the door.</p>

<p>Some one stood looking out of the window, his
face close to the glass. He wore a long black
cloak, beneath which he carried a large oval frame
of some sort. Oliver walked mechanically up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>room, and as he advanced that other turned slowly
towards him. Oliver's heart gave a great
bound, and then stood quite still within him.
The next instant every grain of strength seemed
to slip away from him; his knees grew suddenly
weak and smote together; his hands dropped with
a leaden heaviness to his sides, and his tongue
clave to the roof of his mouth. <i>It was the master!</i></p>

<p>A moment or two of dead silence followed,
and in the heavy, breathless stillness the sharp
ticking of a clock sounded with piercing distinctness
upon Oliver's tensely-drawn nerves. The
master said not a word, but he looked upon him
with a cool, contained smile of ineffable complacency.</p>

<p>At last, somehow, Oliver found his voice.
"You!" he said, hoarsely; and then again, with
a gulp: "You! How came you here?"</p>

<p>The Count de St. Germaine laughed. "How
came I here? I walked here. That does not
satisfy you? Well, no matter. I have, as you
may know, many, very many, ways of coming
and going as I choose. Just now it is sufficient
that I am here."</p>

<p>"And for what have you come?" said Oliver,
in that same slow, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>For a while the master leaned against the deep
window-casing, and looked at him from under
his brows, his eyes burning like green sparks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"For what did I come, Oliver?" said he at
last. "I will tell you. You must know that I
have a silly habit of keeping my promises. Did
I not make you the richest man in France? Did
I not teach you the secret of the water of wealth?
Did I not teach you all that you know, and make
you all that you are? Very good. By so doing
I fulfilled one part of a promise I some time made
you. Now I have come to fulfil the other part.
I promised you then that should you ever return
to Paris I would ruin you; I am going to ruin
you. I promised that I would crush you; I am
about to crush you. I promised to make your
life a hell; I will make it a hell. I will make
you wish a thousand times that you had never
been born. When I first met you in Madame de
Pompadour's salon, I read in your face your fear
that I would betray you. Ah, no! that would
have been childish; it would have been petulant;
it would have been impatient and premature.
No, Oliver; I have waited until now, and what
do you think I have waited for?"</p>

<p>Oliver's lips moved, but he could not answer.
He stood leaning with his hand upon the side of
the table, stunned and dizzied. He felt as though
every word that the master spoke struck a leaden
blow upon his heart. But the other did not wait
for a reply. He flung back his cloak, and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
forth that which he carried beneath it. It was
the magic mirror, upon the face of which was
drawn the sign that, as Oliver knew, stood between
his master and his supernatural power.</p>

<p>The master stood it upon the table beside Oliver,
and then, brushing the dust from his hands,
turned a smiling face upon his victim.</p>

<p>"You cannot guess?" said he, returning to the
question he had asked. "Ah, well, it does not
matter. I will tell you. I intend to pierce your
heart through that young wife of yours, Oliver."</p>

<p>The words struck upon Oliver's ears like a
blow, and like a blow shattered into fragments
the dull, heavy, icy despair that rested upon him.</p>

<p>"My wife!" he cried. "My wife! Oh God!
You devil! You at least shall die!" His dress-sword
hung at his side, and as he spoke he flashed
it out.</p>

<p>But the Count de St. Germaine only laughed.
"Come," said he, "we are silly; we are childish.
Do you think, then, that I am afraid of your
sword? Ha!"</p>

<p>As he uttered the exclamation he struck his
hands sharply together, and it seemed to Oliver
as though the blow had fallen upon him physically.
Sparks of fire danced before his eyes; for
a few seconds his head spun like a teetotum, and
the objects in the room flew around him in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
dizzy horizontal whirl. Suddenly the whirling
stopped, and as his brain recovered from its confusion,
he saw before him again the pale, smiling
face of the master. He still held his sword in his
hand, but he was powerless. It was as though
a leaden weight hung upon his will. He could
move neither hand nor foot.</p>

<p>"Put up your sword, my child," said the Count
de St. Germaine.</p>

<p>Oliver strove to resist the command, but it
was as though his body was not his own&mdash;as
though the master controlled it. His arm appeared
to rise of itself, stiffly, and the sword
slid back again into the scabbard.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the master, "look into the
mirror and see what you shall see; it is spoiled
forever to my sight, but for you its power is as
great as ever. Look!"</p>

<p>Oliver fixed his gaze upon the smooth, brilliant
surface of the glass as he was bidden to do. His
own face stood there for a moment, then blurred,
faded, dissolved. Then on this brilliant surface
he saw Céleste.</p>

<p>She stood in her own room as he stood here
before the glass&mdash;stiffened in every limb&mdash;fixed,
immovable, as though the same leaden power
that overmastered him overmastered her.</p>

<p class="center">"OLIVER FIXED HIS GAZE UPON THE SMOOTH, BRILLIANT
SURFACE OF THE GLASS."</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>The master stood with his eyes fixed upon Oliver's
face, and perhaps he saw in that face all
that Oliver saw in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he, "it is as I had hoped, my dear
Oliver. I congratulate you; your wife is yours
in heart and soul. That is the secret of my
power over her. I reduce you to my will by
my occult power, and at the same time I reduce
her also. Observe now what comes of it."</p>

<p>He made a rapid pass in the air, and in an instant
Oliver saw Céleste's stiff and rigid form
become soft and relaxed. Her face was still
white and stony, her eyes were still set intently
as ever, but she began moving. Reaching her
hand out before her, as though feeling her way
in darkness, she passed out of the door of the
room.</p>

<p>The master had ceased smiling now, and he
stood motionlessly with his gaze fixed upon Oliver's
face. His brows were drawn together; his
eyes sparkled and glanced like those of a snake;
his very head seemed to flatten and broaden
like a serpent's when it fixes its victim. He
made a quick gesture with his hands, and Oliver
saw Céleste stop, take up a cloak from a chair
and wind it around her face and body until
she was completely disguised. Then she moved
again, and presently Oliver saw that she had
passed out into the dark court-yard. As she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
drew near the great gate-way, he saw that it
stood open, although, no doubt, the porter had
long since closed it. Then, in a moment, Céleste
stopped short, and Oliver saw that a coach,
with unlighted lamps, stood near at the open
gate-way. Suddenly the door of the coach
opened, and some one leaped out from within;
swiftly, silently, like a hideous distorted shadow.
The lanterns at the gate were unlighted, but
Oliver knew that distorted, shadow-like figure
at once, and as clearly as though he saw it with
the eyes of his soul&mdash;it was Gaspard. Gaspard
thrust his hand into his bosom and drew forth
something long and dark. As he approached
her Céleste began struggling, as though with
the inflexible though invisible power that held
her. In her struggles the cloak fell away from
her face, and Oliver had one dreadful glimpse of
it. The next instant it was hidden. Gaspard,
with one sudden movement, and in spite of her
blind struggles, had drawn the black bag over
her head and shoulders. At that sight Oliver
gave a shrill, piping, inarticulate cry. The next
instant he saw Gaspard pick her up bodily, and,
running forward, fling her limp, death-like form
into the coach, leap in himself, close the door
with a crash that Oliver almost heard, and the
next moment rumble away into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh God!" whispered Oliver. "Oh God!
Poor Céleste! poor Céleste!"</p>

<p>"That will do," said the master; "you need
look no more;" and in answer to his words Oliver
turned towards him. A shadow of a dusky
pallor lay upon the master's face, and beads of
sweat stood on his forehead.</p>

<p>"It is very difficult," he observed, "to psychologize
two people at once in this way, and
they so far distant from one another. I am glad
that Gaspard has taken charge of the case, and
removed the strain from me."</p>

<p>Oliver heard the words with a certain dumb
consciousness through the agony that hummed
in his ears. He felt his face twitching and
writhing, and drops of sweat trickled down his
forehead. The master replaced his handkerchief
and took a pinch of snuff, looking keenly at his
victim. "You see," said he, "it is uncomfortable,
this being ruined; but then we should have
thought of that before we came back to Paris.
But I am not yet done with you, Oliver. You
have lost your wife; now your wealth must follow.
Do you see this?" and he
drew something from his pocket
and put it upon the table beside him.
It was the phial with the black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>label, marked with this symbol&mdash;

<img src="images/169.jpg" alt="Symbol" style="width: 3%"  />.

that phial which Oliver had brought from the
mysterious chambers. "When you and I parted
company, Oliver, and I asked you whether
you were satisfied with the result of our twelve
months of labor, and you said 'Yes,' you did
not think of or care for this other bottle;
you were contented with the diamonds alone.
It would have been wiser, Oliver, if you had
insisted upon knowing the properties of this
phial of liquor. What they are I will presently
show you. In destroying that mirror with your
accursed signs you did me irreparable harm.
Nevertheless, I know that your diamonds are in
this house, for I have, through certain Amsterdam
merchants, who are agents of mine, taken
care that they should be brought here at this
time. Through your present psychological condition,
I can also read in your mind that you
know where they are. Take this phial, Oliver,
and lead the way to them. I will follow, and
direct you what further to do."</p>

<p>Once more Oliver strove to resist, but he was
powerless. It was as though his will was held
in bonds of steel. He took the phial as the master
directed, and with the same leaden, heavy
steps led the way to the marquis's cabinet, the
master following behind him. With the same
stiff obedience to the master's will, he went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the escritoire, opened it, brought out the keys,
unlocked the chest, and flung back the lid. The
master took the bottle from his resistless hand,
and uncorked it with his gleaming teeth.</p>

<p>What followed, Oliver only partly saw. He
heard a bubbling, hissing sound; he saw a dull,
heavy, yellow smoke arise to the ceiling, where
it spread out to slowly widening rings. Then it
was done, and the master closed the lid.</p>

<p>"And now, Oliver," said he, "since you have
been so kind as to do with your diamonds as I
desired, I will ask you to do one thing more before
we leave this cabinet. Sit down at yonder
table, and write a letter. I will dictate it for
you."</p>

<p>Again Oliver did as he was bidden; he drew
a sheet of paper before him, and dipped the pen
into the ink.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Monseigneur," said the Count de St. Germaine,
and Oliver began writing&mdash;"I thank you
for all of your kindness to me. Those diamonds
were false, and more worthless than paste. What
they are, you may see for yourself by looking
into the chest. I am a charlatan, monseigneur,
and have by a trick imposed these artificial diamonds
upon you. They have now resolved themselves
back into their original form, and I, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
mean time, have escaped from your impending
wrath with your daughter, whom I love. It will
be useless, monseigneur, for you to seek to discover
our hiding-place. Where we have gone you
can never follow. Let me say here that my name
is not Oliver de Monnière-Croix, but that it is
Oliver Munier, and that I am the son of Jean
Munier, a poor tailor of Flourens, as you yourself
might have discovered had you taken the trouble.</p>

<p>"Adieu, monseigneur, and may better luck attend
you at cards than in the choice of your son-in-law.</p>


<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Oliver.</span>"<br />
</p></div>


<p>"There, Oliver," said the Count de St. Germaine,
"this letter will, I flatter myself, put the
finishing-touch to your ruin. Seal it and address
it, and then let us return to the other room.
And you shall call the servant and send the letter
to papa-in-law."</p>

<p>Once more mechanically obeying, Oliver led
the way to the apartment they had quitted.
The master pointed to the bell, and in answer
Oliver struck it. After some delay the servant
appeared, looking with sleepy wonder from Oliver
to the visitor, and back again.</p>

<p>Oliver turned to the man, and then he heard
his own voice speaking as though it belonged to
some one else. "Take this letter directly to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
master," said he. "It is of the greatest importance,
and bid him from me go instantly to
his cabinet. Tell him something has happened
to his diamonds, and that he will see it all for
himself. Go, I say!"</p>

<p>There was something in his tone, something
in his look, that sent the man off like a flash.</p>

<p>The master laughed as the fellow shut the
door. "That man," said he, "has never been so
surprised in his life before. You should have
observed his face when you spoke to him; it was
a study. But now I must leave you, Oliver. I
have some little matters to attend to, and then
I must go and see whether Gaspard has taken
your wife to my apartments as I bade him. I
am obliged to you for having done everything
that I asked you in such an accommodating manner.
In return I will give you a piece of advice:
go to the river, Oliver, and throw yourself
into the water; it is the easiest way to end your
troubles. Your wife you shall never see again
as long as you live. Your fortune"&mdash;he drew
his fingers together, and then spread them quickly
open with a puff&mdash;"it is gone; and papa, the
marquis&mdash;should you happen to fall into his
hands it might be very unpleasant. Yes, take
my advice and throw yourself into the water;
the disagreeableness will be only for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and then your troubles will be over and done
with. Adieu, my child. Now go; it is my order
that you drown yourself."</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Fourth.</span>&mdash;<i>The marquis's dressing-room.</i></h3>


<p>The marquis is discovered reclining in dishabille
beside a table where some five or six tapers
are burning; he has been very wearied with the
excitement of the day. But, on the whole, he is
satisfied with himself; he is glad that Oliver is
going back to Flourens, and still more glad that
he will have entire care of the diamonds. He
holds a book idly in his hand, and gazes upward
at the ceiling as though through a perspective of
pleasant inward thoughts. A knock at the door
awakens him sharply from his reveries, and the
next moment August enters with Oliver's letter.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said the marquis. "Ah! a letter
from Oliver, that dear, simple Oliver. Let
me see what he has to say." He laid aside his
book, and opening the letter, began reading. As
he read, the smile faded from his lips, his jaw
dropped, his eyes glared, and a heavy, ashy, leaden
pallor fell upon his face. As he ended, the letter
dropped from his limp hand and fell fluttering
to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the marquis rose to his feet; he placed
his out-stretched fingers to his forehead, and
stood for a moment or two glaring about him.
Then the color came flaming back to his face; it
grew red, it grew redder, it became purple. Suddenly
he roused himself with a choking, inarticulate
cry. He snatched up one of the candles
from the table and rushed from the room, flinging
aside August, who stood in his way, and sent
him tumbling backward over a chair and falling
with a tremendous clatter to the floor.</p>

<p>He never stopped for an instant until he had
reached his private cabinet, into which he burst
tumultuously. He tore open the escritoire, and
feeling blindly within it, found the key of the
chest. Then he dragged forth the chest, and
thrust the key into the lock. He flung back the
lid, and, leaning over, gazed stupidly down and in.</p>

<p>Where was the glittering treasure that he had
left lying upon those velvet-covered trays? It
was gone! Nothing left but a mass of muddy
charcoal, here and there whitened as though
turned to ashes by the touch of fire, and all wet
with a pungent fluid that had stained the purple
velvet to a dirty reddish-yellow.</p>

<p>"Jean! Edward! François!" It was the
marquis's voice, and it rang terribly through the
silence of the Hôtel de Flourens.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>The next instant there came a crash and a
heavy fall, and when the frightened servants
crowded around the open door and into the marquis's
cabinet, they beheld their master lying
upon his face under the table, with an overturned
chair upon him, and one arm, with its
clinched hand, under his face. He was snoring
with stertorous breathing.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">ACT IV.</h2>



<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene First.</span>&mdash;<i>The Seine at midnight.</i></h3>


<p>Darkness as of death, and, excepting for the
hollow murmur of the river, silence as of the
grave, utter and profound.</p>

<p>The sky above is a dim, misty opalescence of
moonlit stillness; against it rise great, towering,
crazy buildings, sharp-roofed, gabled, as black as
ink. Across the narrow stretch of intervening
water tower other buildings&mdash;crazy, sharp-roofed,
gabled, as black as ink&mdash;and above all loom the
great spires of the church into the pale sky, ponderous,
massive, silent. One broken strip of
moonlight stretches across parapet and roadway
of the bridge, white and still. All around it is
gaping blackness. Suddenly there is a little
movement in the darkness, the sound of a stumbling
step, halting and uneven, and then some
one appears in the white patch of moonlight.
It is Oliver, pale, hollow-eyed, dishevelled, his
hair tangled, his lace cravat torn open at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>throat, his waistcoat unbuttoned, his silk stockings
stained and spattered with mud. He reels
like a drunken man as he struggles against the
invisible power that holds him relentless as fate.
Step by step that power thrusts him, struggling
and shuffling, towards the parapet of the bridge.
He mounts it and flings one leg over the edge.
Beneath him in the inky blackness he can hear
but not see the water rushing onward under the
arches.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one touched Oliver lightly
upon the shoulder, and instantly he felt the same
physical effect that had happened when the master
had struck his hands together in the room at
the Hôtel de Flourens. It was as though a blow
had fallen upon him. Bright sparks danced and
flashed before his eyes, his brain spun like a teetotum
in a dizzy horizontal whirl, and he clutched
the cold stones with his fingers to save himself
from falling. Then suddenly the sparks vanished
and the whirling ceased, and he awoke
sharply as though it were from some horrid
nightmare. He gazed stupidly around him, still
sitting upon the parapet of the bridge; the figure
of a woman stood within ten paces of him,
her waxy-white face turned full upon him, her
unwinking eyes, sparkling in the moonlight, fixed
full upon his.</p>

<p class="center">"SUDDENLY SOME ONE TOUCHED OLIVER SLIGHTLY UPON THE SHOULDER."</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Oliver's heart leaped within him. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>woman whom he had seen in the streets of Flourens
that night when the pretended American uncle
lodged with him and his mother, and her face
looked upon him now just as it had looked upon
him when he peered down upon her from the garret
window. He slipped from the parapet of the
bridge, and, crouching in the shadow on the foot-way,
ran rapidly and noiselessly away from that
dreadful, impassive presence. Then, reaching
the end of the bridge, and without slacking his
speed, he plunged into and wound in and out
through the crooked streets, leading he knew
not whither. Why he ran he did not know, but
something seemed to impel him onward. Suddenly
he passed across another patch of moonlight,
and as he ran plunging into the shadow
upon the farther side, he turned his head and
looked over his shoulder. A keen thrill shot
through the very marrow of his bones; she was
following him&mdash;silently, noiselessly, swiftly. He
quickened his gait into a run, winding his way
in and out through the by-ways. As he passed
into and out of the dull red glare of a solitary
lantern, he looked over his shoulder again. He
could see that dim shape still following him, silent,
ghost-like. His heart gave another great
leap as it had done at first, and then began to
thump against his ribs. The sweat was running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
down his face in streams, his breath came thick
and heavy, and he felt as though he were stifling,
but still he ran onward in swift headlong flight,
though his feet felt heavy and leaden, as they
do in a nightmare dream.</p>

<p>On he dashed through mud and puddles in
the crooked streets or on the side-way, for
he did not choose his path now through the
empty blackness, now across a patch of moonlight,
now under the dull glare of a lantern.
He had no need to look behind, for his soul
knew that she still followed. Suddenly he saw
a narrow, crooked passage-way in front of him.
Without pausing to think, he doubled like a
hare and shot into it. It opened into a stony
court surrounded with squalid houses, huge,
black, silent. At the farther end was a blind
wall, and Oliver's heart crumbled away within
him, for an escape was at an end. He darted
one look over his shoulder&mdash;she was there; he
could just see the dim outline of her form flitting
through the darkness. The next moment
he ran headlong against the wall and there flattened
himself, spreading out his palms over the
rough surface, hiding his face against his hands,
panting and sobbing like a dumb creature.</p>

<p>Five seconds passed, ten, twenty. Oliver looked
fearfully over his shoulder, and then hid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
face again; she was there, silent, motionless; the
faint glimmer of her white face turned full upon
him. Again he looked; she neither approached
him nor drew away, and by-and-by the impassive
harmlessness of her stillness seemed to breathe a
breath of softness upon the black rigor of his terror.
A faint spark of courage began to glimmer
in his heart, and one by one the scattered forces of
his will, torn asunder by the tumult of his blind
terror, began to gather together and to cohere
into some form.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a quick flash of thought
to his mind. It was plain she meant him no
harm, and she was in some mysterious way connected
with the strange dark life of the master:
might she not give him some news of Céleste?
He turned suddenly around towards the woman,
and instantly as he did so, exactly timing her
movements with his, she also turned. Fearing
she might escape, he stepped quickly forward;
instantly she began to move away; he quickened
his pace, she also quickened hers; he began to
run, her feet moved quickly, silently; she seemed
to make no exertion, but he neither gained nor
lost a foot. At last, seeing the uselessness of
this crazy race through the silent and deserted
streets, he finally stopped; instantly he did so,
she also stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it you want of me?" said Oliver.
Then, again, receiving no reply, "What is it you
want of me?"</p>

<p>Still she made no answer, but stood there motionless,
silent.</p>

<p>"Then go your way!" he burst out, desperately,
at last. "I know you now. You are like
all the rest; you are a devil!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned and began to walk
away, but he had not gone twenty steps when,
looking over his shoulder, he saw that she was
following him again, as she had followed him
at first. Again he stopped and turned, and
again, as though she were his shadow, she also
stopped and turned. A long pause of silence followed.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Oliver, at last, "I do not
know why you thus choose to dog my footsteps;
is there anything that you desire of me?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>He waited for a while; the silence weighed
upon him like lead. "I have done you no harm,"
said he, at last; "why do you follow me thus
persistently? Are you set as a spy upon me?
Surely the master has ruined me enough! Does
he desire that I should take my own life? I was
about to destroy it when I saw you at the bridge
over there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited breathlessly for a reply, but there
was no answer.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he burst out after a while.
"You frighten me with your dreadful, mysterious
presence! What have I to do with you, or
you with me?"</p>

<p>She remained as motionless and as silent as a
statue.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Oliver. "It is less dreadful to
follow you than to have you pursue me. Yes, I
will follow you. It is but of little consequence
whither you take me, for nothing worse can
happen to me than that which I have already
suffered. Yes, I will follow you." He advanced
as he spoke; the woman moved away.</p>

<p>This time Oliver did not hasten his steps as he
had done heretofore, but, keeping his eyes upon
her, followed her doggedly and stubbornly.</p>

<p>Once more they came out upon the street
which they had at first left, and so to the bridge,
which they crossed. Now and then, dreading
lest he might lose her in the blackness of the
night, Oliver hastened his steps, but invariably
she quickened hers, so that at last he gave over
any fear that she might escape. A hope began
to grow and expand in his bosom: whither was
she leading him? On and on they went; Oliver
took no heed whither. The streets now became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
broader and better lighted; they had come to
a better quarter of the town. But Oliver did
not look about him; he kept his eyes fixed upon
his mysterious guide; now he did not dare to
lose her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned at right angles and entered
a narrow, closed alley-way. Oliver hurried
after, and as he emerged into a little,
stony court lit by the dull red glow of a lantern,
he saw her whom he followed pause for an instant
before a door-way, and the next moment
enter.</p>

<p>He leaned against the wall beside which he
stood, shuddering and trembling in the rush of a
blinding hope. But there was no time for hesitation;
he must follow instantly if he would not
lose sight of his silent guide. He advanced boldly,
and without a moment's hesitation pushed
open the door and entered the passage-way
within.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Scene Second.</span>&mdash;<i>The master's apartments.</i></h3>


<p>His guide must have been waiting for him,
for, by the light of the lantern without, he saw
that silent and mysterious figure moving before
him, like a part of the shadowy darkness itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
For some distance he made his way along the
gloomy passage, feeling with his hand against
the wall. Suddenly he fell, with a noisy rattle
and clatter, upon the lower steps of a stair-way
that led steeply up into a yawning blackness
above.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate a moment, but began ascending
the stairs, still feeling his way with one
hand against the wall and the other stretched
out in the darkness before him. So he came at
last to a little landing-place, and advancing slowly,
his other hand presently touched the panels
of a door. He fumbled for a second or two until
he found the latch, then lifting it with a click,
he entered.</p>

<p>The bare, plastered passage-way through which
he had come must have been the rear entrance
to the apartments above, for, passing through
the door, he found himself in what appeared to
be a small dining-room, as well as he could see
from the light that came from the stair-way beyond.
It also seemed to be richly and luxuriously
furnished, and he saw the multiple glimmering
twinkle of the light in the passage-way
beyond flickering upon polished silver and glass.</p>

<p>But he had no time for observation, for before
him he saw the figure which he followed just
passing through the door upon the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the apartment, and he hurried forward without
stopping.</p>

<p>Beyond the dining-room he came out upon a
broad landing-place of a stair-way, which upon
the one hand led to the apartments above, and
upon the other to the ground-floor beneath.
The flitting, shadow-like figure of his mysterious
guide crossed this landing-place to a door-way
opposite, and as Oliver, without a moment's hesitation,
followed, he found himself in a dressing-room.
By the ruddy light of the fire that
glowed cheerfully in the grate, he saw that the
room was empty; the woman had evidently
passed through the door-way upon the other
side of the apartment, and so into the room beyond.
Again Oliver hurried forward, and laid
his hand upon the knob of the door. He tried
it; the door was locked.</p>

<p>A hat with a black feather lay upon the table;
his eyes fell upon it, and then his heart leaped
into his throat. It was the first spark of recognition,
and then in a flash that recognition was
complete: it was to the Count de St. Germaine's
apartments that he had been led by this strange,
silent guide.</p>

<p class="center">"'CÉLESTE!' BREATHED OLIVER THROUGH THE CRACK OF THE DOOR."</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>As Oliver stood there looking about him, a
faint sound broke through the stillness&mdash;a dull,
stifled, moaning cry. Again his heart bounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>within him. He bent his head and listened at
the crack of the door. Could he have been mistaken?
He fancied that he heard a faint rustling
in the room within, and then&mdash;yes, there could
be no mistake this time! It was the sound of
some one crying. "Céleste!" breathed Oliver
through the crack of the door.</p>

<p>No answer; even the faint rustling that he
had heard had ceased. Oliver's heart throbbed
as though it would stifle him; the blood hummed
in his ears.</p>

<p>"Céleste!"</p>

<p>"Who is there?" answered a faint voice from
within. That voice was sodden and husky with
tears, but Oliver recognized it. For a moment
or two, in the revulsion of his feelings, he turned
giddy and faint. Then he began to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Céleste," he sobbed, "it is I&mdash;it is Oliver!
I am come to save you. Open the door,
Céleste, and let me in!"</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Céleste. "It is locked; there
is no key."</p>

<p>"But the woman who has just entered," said
Oliver, "has she not the key?"</p>

<p>"The woman?" said Céleste. "Of whom do
you speak, Oliver? No one has entered here
since that dreadful man who brought me here
went away and left me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver looked around him. Could she&mdash;that
mysterious woman&mdash;have left the room by any
other way? No; there were but two doors&mdash;the
door through which he had followed her and
the door at which he now stood. She could
have left the room in no other way. It was
very strange, but Oliver dismissed the subject
from his mind. This was no time to wonder
over the many mysteries that involved the dark
life of the Count de St. Germaine. He must
save Céleste. "Courage, Céleste!" he breathed
through the door. "I must go and leave you,
but I go to bring help to you. I will save you,
Céleste!"</p>

<p>He had no plan for saving her, as he thus
promised to do; but in the elation of his feelings
upon having thus found her, and in the elasticity
of his youthful confidence, he felt sure of his
ability to do something.</p>

<p>"But, tell me, Oliver," said Céleste, "where
am I? Why have I been brought here? What
is to happen to me? Who was the horrible man
that drew that awful black hood over my face
in the garden?"</p>

<p>"You are in the apartments of the Count de
St. Germaine," answered Oliver. "He of whom
you speak was that Gaspard, and&mdash;and I&mdash;do
not know what they will do to you, Céleste.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>But courage, my love. I <i>must</i> go; but do not
be afraid; I will save you, I swear it! But I
must go. If they find me here they will kill
me&mdash;What was that?"</p>

<p>It was the sound of the closing of a door
below; of footsteps crossing the landing upon
which Oliver had followed his silent guide.</p>

<p>"Gaspard!"</p>

<p><i>It was the voice of the Count de St. Germaine!</i></p>

<p>Oliver stood as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>He cast his despairing eyes around. Where
should he escape? To leave by the door was to
face the master, whose footsteps he could hear
already climbing the stairs towards the room.
The window? That meant horrible death upon
the pavement beneath.</p>

<p>The wardrobe! The thought was an inspiration.
It stood against the farther wall of the
room, a huge, ponderous structure of carved and
polished wood, inlaid with arabesque patterns of
lighter colors. There was no time to lose; the
master was almost at the door.</p>

<p>The wardrobe was divided into two compartments
separated by a wooden partition, against
which the folding doors closed. Oliver climbed
into one of the sides and among the clothes that
hung from the hooks above, closing the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>behind him. As he did so he heard the footsteps
of the Count de St. Germaine enter the
room.</p>

<p>Gaspard, with his usual silent, cat-like step,
must have accompanied the master, bearing a
light, for a bright yellow ray fell through the
key-hole and traversed the clothes amid which
Oliver stood, as though some one crossed the
room with a candle.</p>

<p>Oliver scarcely dared breathe as he stood
there with palpitating heart, the sweat trickling
down his face in streams. He swallowed and
swallowed; his mouth was dry and clammy.</p>

<p>The Count de St. Germaine spoke; his voice
sounded loud and resonant upon Oliver's tensity
of nervous strain.</p>

<p>"Put the lights upon the table there, Gaspard,
and bring me my dressing-gown and slippers
from the wardrobe yonder."</p>

<p>The words fell upon Oliver's ears like a death-knell.
He braced himself to bear the coming
shock. It seemed to him that his brain swelled
like a soap-bubble, with a hollow, ringing expansion.
He heard Gaspard's soft footfalls approaching
the closet; it seemed as though it
took minutes for him to cross the room. He
heard the clever servant's fingers fumbling at the
door, and then the wardrobe was opened&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>not the side upon which he stood; the dressing-gown
and slippers hung in the other compartment.</p>

<p>Oliver's heart gave a great leap, and then he
fell to trembling in every joint. Gaspard closed
the door of the wardrobe again, and Oliver could
hear his soft footfalls recrossing the floor, and
then the silky rustling as the master put on the
dressing-gown and slippers.</p>

<p>"That is good," said the count. "Now go
and bring my chocolate, and then we will look
at the girl in the room yonder. She is very
pretty."</p>

<p>Oliver heard the words as clearly as though
he had been standing beside the speaker. In an
instant his prostrating terror vanished like a
flash, and in its place blazed up a consuming
flame of rage. He clinched his hands together
until his finger-nails cut into his palms. He was
upon the point of flinging open the door of the
wardrobe and bursting out into the room&mdash;of
clutching that smooth, complacent devil by the
throat. Luckily for him, his reason still had
some governance over his action. What could
he, Oliver Munier, do against the powers of hell
that the master had at his command? No; he
must wait, he must suffer to the last.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur," said Gaspard, and Oliver
could almost see the wretch leer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he heard Gaspard close the door. A little
time of silence followed. Then the Count
de St. Germaine began walking restlessly up
and down the room, and after a while he fell to
muttering to himself, and as he passed and repassed
close by the wardrobe, Oliver could catch
snatches of what he was saying.</p>

<p>"What is it that lies upon me to-night? Yes;
I feel an influence in this room.&mdash;Bah! I am a
fool! Why should I fear? I have crushed and
annihilated the only one who the stars say could
harm me.&mdash;Those stars lied. What harm could
a heavy, loutish peasant lad do to me?&mdash;Yes; he
must be drifting down the waters of the Seine
by now, rolled over and over, perhaps, in the
mud at the bottom.&mdash;Peste! To think of his
having the wit to destroy that mirror of mine!
If I could only consult it now I could make sure
that he is out of my way.&mdash;Those fools are sometimes
possessed with certain cunning of their
own." So he continued muttering to himself,
passing and repassing the wardrobe.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped in his walk and his soliloquy,
and Oliver heard a tinkling chink of china.
It was Gaspard bringing in the chocolate. Then
he heard the sound of a chair drawn back, and
then the faint gurgle of the liquor poured into
the cup, the rattle of the sugar in the bowl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the click of the spoon. There was a pause, and
he could distinctly hear the master take a sip.
He replaced the cup.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Gaspard, the girl," said he;
"bring her&mdash;" He stopped abruptly, and a long
pause of silence followed. "What!" at length
exclaimed the Count de St. Germaine. "Is it
you again? What, then, do you desire? This
makes the third time this week. Listen! I
have warned you, I have besought you, but it
seems that I can influence you neither by the
one nor the other. I am weary of this importunity.
I will reason no more. Gaspard!"</p>

<p>Oliver heard a quick step, a rustling, and then
the sound of a fierce, silent struggle. Heretofore
he had been afraid to move in the wardrobe;
now he could resist no longer. He stooped,
and peered through the hole. Just across
the room from him was Gaspard, grinning horribly
as he struggled silently with some one.
Yes; it was with the woman whom Oliver had
followed there.</p>

<p>But that struggle lasted only for a moment.
The next, Gaspard had drawn his black bag over
her head, as Oliver had seen him do once before.
Then the struggle instantly ceased, and she stood
silent, immovable. Gaspard picked her up, flung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>her over his shoulder, turned, and the next moment
had vanished out of the narrow range of
Oliver's outlook, who, however, still remained
with his eye glued to the key-hole.</p>

<p>Suddenly an object intervened; it was the
back of the master's dressing-gown. Oliver
could see nothing but just that little circle of
cashmere cloth; the master was not four feet
away from him. The cashmere cloth was innocent
enough, but the sight of it filled Oliver
again with that blind, ungovernable rage. He
straightened himself from his observations at the
key-hole. But as he did so his elbow struck
against the partition alongside of him. He
heard a rustle, and knew as well as though he
had seen it that his master had turned quickly.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said the Count de St. Germaine's
voice, sharply.</p>

<p>Oliver knew that he was discovered, and thereupon
his blind rage broke through all restraints
of reason and caution. "It is I!" he roared;
and flinging wide the door of the wardrobe, he
sprang like a cat at the throat of the other. As
he sprang he clutched, and as he clutched he felt
his fingers instinctively close not only around
the soft folds of the cravat, but also around the
links of a chain beneath.</p>


<p><a name="I194"></a></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">"HE FOUND IN HIS CLINCHED HAND A LACE CRAVAT."</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The master went staggering back at the unexpected
attack, and as he did so his slipper heel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>caught in the edge of the rug behind him, and
he fell. But as he fell he shouted aloud, "Gaspard!
Help!"</p>

<p>It was all over in an instant. The master lay
prostrate on the floor, and as Oliver staggered
back from the recoil of the attack, he found in
his clutched hand a lace cravat and the chain,
which had parted from the Count de St. Germaine's
neck with a sharp snap. Something
hung by the chain. It was a little silver case,
thicker than, but about half as long, as a snuffbox.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause as Oliver stood
glaring at the master, still unconsciously clutching
the cravat and the chain in his hand. The
other had raised himself, and was now staring
back at Oliver with wild, dilated eyes, and a
face haggard and white as death. The next instant
he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"My talisman!" he shrieked. "Give it to
me!" and he raised his quivering fist in the air
as though he would strike Oliver with it.</p>

<p>At the same instant a shrill, exultant voice
sounded at the door: "Keep it, Monsieur Oliver,
keep it! Do not give it to him! It is his life!"</p>

<p>It was Gaspard who spoke. And as Oliver
turned his dazed eyes, he saw the clever servant
standing in the door-way, hopping up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
grinning, wagging his head, and waving his bony,
sinewy hands madly hither and thither.</p>

<p>Oliver was stupefied with the tempest of passions
that raged in and about him. The master
might have taken what he chose, and he could
not have moved to resist him. But this the
master did not do. He gave a shrill, piping,
despairing cry, and the next moment made a
rush for the door, his cashmere dressing-gown
flying behind him like brilliant wings. He flung
Gaspard aside, and the next instant Oliver heard
his pattering feet flying up the stairs.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" said Oliver, stupidly.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" cried Gaspard. "Are
you a fool? Open the box! open the box!"</p>

<p>Oliver mechanically obeyed him.</p>

<p>Within was a little roll of soft linen, yellow
with age. He unrolled it, and within that again
found a little crystal ball about the size of a
dove's egg. He could see that it contained what
appeared to be a dull, phosphorescent mass that,
as he held it in his hand, seemed to pulse and
throb in the light of the candle; now glowing
with a bluish light, now fading away to a dull,
milky opalescence.</p>

<p>Again, for the third time, Gaspard's snarling
voice broke on his ear. "Oh, thou fool! See
him stand like a lump! Pig! Do you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
know that the master is busy with his books?
A moment more and all is lost! Crush that
ball, or you are a dead man!"</p>

<p>His words spurred Oliver to sudden action.
He raised the globe high in the air, and flung it
upon the floor with all his force. It burst with
a flash of light and a report like a pistol, and instantly
the air was filled with a pungent, reddish
vapor.</p>

<p>The next instant, as the thunder follows the
flash of lightning, there came a dull, heavy rumbling,
as from the cellar, and the floor swayed
beneath Oliver's feet, as though the house were
toppling. He looked around; the door-way at
which Gaspard had stood was empty; the clever
servant was gone.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a confusion of sounds broke
upon the stillness of the house: struggles and
scuffles, snarling of voices, and squeaking as
though of rats, the rattle and crash of furniture
pushed about, thumping and banging as of people
wrestling and falling against the doors. The
next instant there was a sound of a heavy fall, a
shrill, long-drawn, quavering scream, and then
the lull of dead silence.</p>

<p>Oliver stood like a statue, listening, as though
he had been turned to stone. He heard a door
open, and then the sound of footsteps, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
strange clacking and clattering upon the stairs
without; a heavy panting and breathing. Oliver
ran to the door and looked up the stairs. Gaspard
was coming down out of the black gloom
above. Over his shoulders he carried something
limp, like an empty skin or a bundle of clothes
tied together. Part of what he carried he
dragged clattering down the steps behind him;
another part, a round lump the size of a man's
head, hung down over his shoulder, wagging
from side to side. The next moment the clever
servant had come into the square of light from
the open door-way of the room. That light fell
full upon the round lump that hung wagging
from his shoulder, and in the one instant of passing,
Oliver saw a dreadful, a hideous face, ashy-white,
and with eyes rolled, one upward and one
downward, so that only a rim of the pupils
showed. The jaws gaped and clapped as the
head wagged from side to side. It was the face
of the Count de St. Germaine.</p>

<p class="center">"OVER HIS SHOULDERS HE CARRIED SOMETHING LIMP, LIKE

</div>
</div>


<p>Oliver stood spellbound, horrified, watching
Gaspard as he descended the steep flight of steps,
bearing that ghastly burden. As the clever
servant passed under the dull light of the lamp
below he turned his head and looked up. His
mouth gaped wide with impish, noiseless laughter;
he thrust his tongue into his cheek, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>with an ugly leer and wink of one of his black,
bead-like eyes, he passed by and down the steps
beyond, the feet of the figure clicking from step
to step behind him.</p>

<p>Oliver watched him until he reached the bottom
of the steps and passed out from the house
into the night beyond; there was the bang of a
closing door, and then dead silence.</p>

<p>The next moment Oliver was at the door of
the room wherein Céleste was confined. "Céleste!"
he screamed, "for God's sake, come!
Leave this awful place!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" answered Céleste from within.
"Am I then saved?"</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Oliver, in the same shrill voice,
"you are saved! But come! come!"</p>

<p>"But the door," said Céleste. "It is locked,
Oliver."</p>

<p>"Ah, peste! I had forgotten. Stand away
from it." As he spoke, he rushed against the
door, flinging himself bodily upon it. It shook,
but did not open. Again he dashed himself
against it, and this time with better success.
The lock snapped, and as it flew open inward
Oliver plunged headlong into the room beyond.</p>

<p>Céleste stood, white and terrified, in the middle
of the floor. "But am I indeed saved?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
she. "Where, then, is Monsieur de St. Germaine?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me, Céleste," cried Oliver, hoarsely.
"Come!"</p>

<p>As they passed through the room beyond, Céleste
looked up into his face.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried. "What has happened,
Oliver? Tell me."</p>

<p>But Oliver could not answer; he only shook
his head.</p>

<p>Upon the landing without, Céleste suddenly
stopped and laid her hand upon his arm.
"Hark!" said she. "What is that?"</p>

<p>Oliver listened breathlessly. A dull, monotonous
sobbing sounded through the house. It
came from the apartment above.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oliver!" cried Céleste, "go and see what
it is."</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head. "I cannot go," said
he, huskily. "I am afraid. You do not know,
Céleste, what an awful place this is! If you
had seen what I have just beheld&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you must go," said Céleste; "perhaps it
is another in trouble like myself. I will wait
for you here, Oliver; I am not afraid."</p>

<p>Oliver could not resist such an appeal; he
turned, and began heavily ascending the stairs
to the floor above. A door at a little distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
stood ajar; it was thence that the monotonous
sounds came. He advanced hesitatingly towards
it, and reaching out his hand, pushed it, and it
gaped slowly open upon the room beyond. Oliver
only looked within for a moment, and then
turned and walked stupidly away, but what he
saw in that one glance was impressed upon his
mind in an image never to be erased.</p>

<p>Tables and chairs were overturned; books lay
torn and scattered upon the floor. In the middle
of the room sat the woman whom he had
first seen in the moonlit street at Flourens, and
her pale, vacant eyes were fixed blankly upon
him. Her white lips were slightly parted, but
there was never a twitch upon the face that
uttered those monotonous sobs that sounded
dully through the silence.</p>

<p>Upon the floor lay stretched, bruised, battered,
and bleeding, the withered, shrunken figure of
an aged man, his limbs a mass of dried skin and
bones. The yellow, parchment-like skin was
stretched over his head and his face so tightly
that it seemed as though it would crack. The
shadow of death brooded upon him as he gazed
with filmy, sightless eyes into the dark hollow
of eternity that lay beyond. His breast, for a
long time motionless, now and then heaved convulsively
with the laboring breath. Such was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the vision that Oliver saw in that one glance.
Then he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>"Who was it, Oliver?" said Céleste.</p>

<p>Oliver answered never a word, but taking her
by the hand, led her forcibly down the stairs
and out of the house.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>


<p>There was a seven days' gossip in Paris. All
manner of rumors were afloat, for strange things
had happened at the Hôtel de Flourens. The
marquis had had a sudden stroke of apoplexy
upon the very day of his daughter's wedding.
But when they had called the family, she and
that handsome young husband of hers were
nowhere to be found. They had left the hôtel,
and did not return again until long after nightfall.
Where they had been was a profound secret
which they kept locked within their own
breasts. But the poor marquis, he was dying.
He had never once spoken since he had fallen
under the attack. Dr. Raymond-Brasse, and the
other physicians who attended him, said that it
would be little less than a miracle if he lasted
until Wednesday.</p>

<p>Presently other rumors began to get abroad.
That vast, fabulous wealth of the interesting
Count de Monnière-Croix had vanished; not a
crumb of it was left. The debt had been paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>off, both upon the château and upon the hôtel,
but that was all. It was almost inconceivable
that the marquis had squandered that stupendous
fortune away in three months, but how
else could the matter be explained? It was all
very strange and mysterious.</p>

<p>Another thing agitated the world. The Count
de St. Germaine had vanished! He had gone!
It was rumored that the Prince of Hesse-Cassel
had sent for him, and that he had departed.
Certainly the Paris world saw him no more.</p>

<h2>AFTER THE PLAY.</h2>


<p>Ting! A-ling! A-ling! Bring down the curtain,
the extravaganza is ended. The red and blue
flames are quenched, the pasteboard scenery is
pushed back against the wall, the mock jewelry
is tumbled into the bandbox, and all the characters
have gone into their dressing-rooms to wash
the paint off their faces. The lights are out,
and nothing is left.</p>

<p>But what does it mean? Who was Monsieur
de St. Germaine? Who was Gaspard? Who
was the old man who died just now? And that
mysterious woman, was she the better life of
Nicholas Jovus, which he had materialized along
with the evil life? Was it possible that he
could not materialize the one without the other?
Does it all mean&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good friend, why do you ask me? You
have seen just as much of this extravaganza
as I."</p>
